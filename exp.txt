There were good performances by Robin Williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews br br I thought Sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts , quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them br br I think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos I expect most retail workers want a break from the customers 
The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co stars in this movie She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role I do n't consider it a supporting role either , but rather a bit part Also the plot has many unexplained elements Some examples are why does the main character reject her oldest son \? Why does her youngest son drive head on into the train \? He says its for a sucker bet which does n't explain anything Obviously the screenwriter does n't know the definition of a sucker bet This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion Save your money and view it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen 
I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind That being said , I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I 've seen in some time br br To have a good movie , you need to have a well written screenplay Left Behind fell woefully short on this For one thing , it radically deviates from the book Sometimes this is done to condense a 400 page novel down to a two hour film , but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever br br Another thing , there is zero character development When characters in the story get saved \( I wo n't say who \) , the book makes it clear that it 's a long , soul searching process In the film it 's quick and artificial The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele , Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real , but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind \( again , I wo n't say who \) , it seems artificial br br I realize as a Christian it 's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film , but I ca n't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done Perhaps it would 've been better to make the first book into 2 3 films Either way , Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers , we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind , but that 's the way I see it 
Sexo Cannibal , or Devil Hunter as it 's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences , starts with actress model Laura Crawford \( Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner \) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane \( Gisela Hahn \) After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character 's named Chris \( Werner Pochath \) Thomas \( Antonio Mayans \) burst in kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane Laura 's agent gets on the blower to rent a hero Peter Weston \( Al Cliver \) who is informed of the situation , the kidnappers have Laura on an isolated island are demanding a 6 million ransom Peter is told that he will be paid 200 , 000 to get her back safely a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well , faster than a rat up a drain pipe Peter his Vietnam Vet buddy helicopter pilot Jack are on the island deciding on how to save Laura So , the kidnappers have Laura Peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe \( hell , in all the generations they 've lived there they 've only managed to build one straw hut , now that 's primitive \) who worship some cannibal monster dude \( Burt Altman \) with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young , white female flesh intestines br br This Spanish , French German co production was co written directed by the prolific Jesus Franco who also gets the credit for the music as well Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the UK as it was placed on the 'Video Nasties' list in the early 80 's under it 's alternate Devil Hunter title therefore officially classed as obscene banned , having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film even Franco , who is n't afraid to be associated with a turkey , decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of Clifford Brown I 'd imagine even the most die hard Franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing The script by Franco , erm sorry I mean Clifford Brown Julian Esteban as Julius Valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed , is awful It 's as simple straight forward as that For a start the film is so boring it 's untrue , the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I 've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things do n't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success , this is one to avoid br br Director Franco shows his usual incompetence throughout , a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression it 's not attached to anything ! The cannibal scenes are poor , the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'A' to 'B' not really doing anything when they get there either It becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about 10 minutes do n't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it 's uncut state I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff , this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it 's side having Cliver crawl along the floor ! Just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along ! The gore is n't that great as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame , there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat , a man is impaled on spikes , there 's some blood a handful of intestines There 's a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal an unpleasant rape scene br br Sexo Cannibal must have had a low budget I mean low This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic The music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen The acting sucks , the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act br br Sexo Cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible , one to avoid 
My favorite quote from Crow was , when the car was going off the cliff , The movie is so bad , even the car wants to get out of it ! br br This had to be the funniest movie I have ever seen It was seriously out there to scare you , which makes it even funnier ! If it were n't for Mystery Science Theater I would n't be here today ! P
Horrendous pillaging of a classic br br It was n't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him , but he still does n't help himself at all with his actions \( inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives , etc \) This , in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him , but this somehow does n't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken identity murder game later on Which in itself is also ridiculous 'So and so is the real killer plus her as well also him ! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative did n't need extending br br It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again , but that 's about the only small pleasure to be had It 's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock , and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you should n't be bothering at all 
It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this movie No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium br br The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs , is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC br br After she leaves the mall , she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her Tell me , what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded , and insult them verbally \? I do n't mean after an attack had already started , because then of course it 's completely normal for someone to fight back But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level No woman would do that unless she 1 \) had a weapon , 2 \) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close , and so is relatively safe from harm , or 3 \) the attackers are so young , and weak looking that she 's pretty sure she can take them None of that applied in this situation , so she was just acting like someone that 's asking to get raped or mugged And by the way , when the security guard approached , as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger , why would n't she immediately either run towards him for help , or scream \? \? br br When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head , she drives into a deserted part of town , and crashes She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers , instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing , she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood I understand she was trying to fix her car , but she should 've ran br br \( I did n't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie , because I loathe people who do that in their reviews , but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it \) br br Why would she carry a loud , Red Toolbox as she 's trying to sneak away in the dark \? When she does get caught , one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox First she resists , then eventually opens it And takes out a wrench This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down , it 's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie When asked to open the box , she 's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she did n't open it , in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch push open manipulate , and once that hero refuses to open it , the enemy grabs that device , only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical shoot him in the face render him unconscious , which was the hero 's plan all along It feels like that 's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here , as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs , and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs br br Throughout the rest of the movie , basically what you see is this suburban house wife , sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox , taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS br br When she was running away , how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were \? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them br br Finally , this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she 's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective , she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier , and so they felt they had to kill her How ridiculous As one of the thugs even said , they could 've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from , no one but her had seen them anyway , and she probably did n't get the license plate Even if these possibilities would n't work in their favor , how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder \? 
 br br One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role , to be a funny movie This is not the case here I laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie , and that was n't even during the final comedy scene \( which one would also expect to be the funniest \) This is one you can watch when it comes to TV , do n't spend any other money renting it 
Imagine , its , say 12 1am your at home , your bored , your not tired This scenario occurred about , say 4 or so years back I turned on the TV and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on OH MY WORD this is the worst film I have ever seen ! A runaway car that cant be stopped \( cos the brakes have been cut or something \) in caning it down the freeway whats gonna happen \? ! This film was so bad its actually funny I think the stunts cost about 2 to make , there was one instance where a baby small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter in an attempt to excite the viewer a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead THIS IS THE BEST BAD BIT OF A FILM EVER it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used total low budget classic ! Cant remember the end of the film , though but I bet it was GREAT br br I doubt they will ever show this film again so I'm glad I got to see this piece of trash ! 
Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers , and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie Well , all I can say is I totally regretted it ! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant , unimaginative and kitch to the extreme \( not that this is bad on its own \) sketches that are supposed to make people laugh , but fail to do so The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend , and they decided to support his movie by starring in it I ca n't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap ! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack have n't disappointed me ever since I would recommend you to avoid this film , unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled 
Unbelievable ! br br this film gets a 7 out 0f 10 This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad , the storyline \( if you can call it that \) was just as bad Offcourse everyone knows what 's going to happen within the first 5 minutes Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment That however , is not the case There is no action , no suspense , not even a spark between the 2 leading actors It was unfortunately a waste of my time , and certainly a waste of my money br br and the 2 of merely for trying
This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues That is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it br br I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin Elvira suicides at the end , but instead of this , in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young , this happened and he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there , etc br br Soon in the movie , Erwin Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute \( certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat \) , and while telling her the story of Elvira 's life , Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of I have suffered much in my life , and am about to die br br In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something , Erwin Elvira encounters a former lover , that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys \( as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality \) is that he recognizes Elvira br br There are some interesting shots and ideas , I must admit \( such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin \) , but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder 's self indulgence 
He really lost the plot with this one ! None of his distinctive trademarks here at all , an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film \( in my opinion \) Even his trademark gore is gone , bar one scene in an operating theatre Oh well , at least his next film 'Nightmare Concert' showed that he could still shock when he wanted to 
Priyadarshan whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be 'comedy' That is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama , Hera Pheri and Hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I ca n't recollect for now Now with hideous films like Dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be 'torture' br br Dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent br br Speaking of the acting , I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top \( if you compare them with the others in the movie \) , then came Tusshar Kapoor , then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting The grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly br br The plot was the same , seen before one Four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb And at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty br br The worst thing about the movie is its length After an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater But being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place br br If your mother in law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun 3 out of 10 
This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but , in my view , begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down That this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough , but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family 's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories br br I found this movie average at best Art direction could have been much better , as could have been cinematography The acting was good , and so was Eva van der Gucht 's singing 
Some movies are repellent but still fascinating \( Pulp Fiction \) others are simply boring This movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring By the end I did n't care about any of the characters , I just wanted all of them dead so I could get out of the theatre 
The reasons to watch this knock off err tribute to a great movie called Se7en It 's on while your channel surfing and there 's nothing else on Someone pays you to watch it br br Do yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en , rent it , download it on iTunes , or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely The Flock the same story with with a few changes Furthermore the editing just wreaks of Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times The worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots , with sounds of people people chattering over the radio , except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one br br Bottom line I call it a blatant knock off If you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film , go ahead , but either way go watch Se7en 
Watching this Movie \? l thought to myself , what a lot of garbage These girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it Waste of time watching it , faint heavens l only hired it The acting was below standard and story was unbearable Anyone contemplating watching this film , please save your money The film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than Attack of the Green Tomatoes br br l only hope that this piece of trash did n't cost too much to make Money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there is n't a sequel in the pipeline 
In my opinion , this movie 's title should be changed from Only the Brave to All About Lane I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome Although , I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry the acting in some parts of film was quite stale The performances of Marc Dacascos , Tamlyn Tomita , and Jason Scott Lee were all great However , the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie Sorry Lane , you are just not a film actor Stick to what you 're good at theater acting Gina Hiraizumi 's performance in this film was also horrible She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful Why were n't they cast for that role \? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences The Japanese American soldiers do n't look like they were fighting German soldiers let alone anyone Granted this was a low budget feature , but since this was a war based film , is n't it important to show some actually fighting \? This film was a worthy attempt , but definitely not worth a major distribution 
this film is in the MANDINGO DRUM type br br they were both dreadful BUT they are 100 better than this tripe , br br Badly acted made Oliver Reed is the main name Eartha Kitt also is in it Tis a pity Rating is 1 2 about as low as yu can get br br as always br br jay harris
About the only thing I liked about this film is that there was JUST enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end I kept thinking that maybe in the NEXT scene things would gel Alas br br Those who like Gus Van Sant 's films especially his later ones will probably like this Personally , I find van Sant 's films to be dull , pretentious and facile Well , he was an executive producer for this film , so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him although personally I actually liked this better than van Sant 's latest efforts \( e g Elephant \) br br Contrary to many here , I did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed , I thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all But I feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough and not only that , but that the mood painted here is , to my mind , incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening The dream like quality , so closely linked to nature , is beautifully captured here , but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child , one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold \( waves on a beach , grasses and flowers , spiders etc \) The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life When you are caught up in a crush on someone or being the object of bullying at school you are anything BUT languorous ! There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film SPOILERS HERE first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid especially with no father present seemed real to me br br The second , and ONLY part of the film with any tension to it , were the scenes where Leah \( Logan 's re creation of himself \) phones Rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone sex The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voice over of Leah was the most convincing actor in the entire film \( It made me think of Claire Danes from My So Called Life the voice even sounded like Claire \) She and Rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along it was perhaps the best moment in the film as finally ! we got some character development br br All in all , a somewhat misplaced effort we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director 's possible talents In the meantime , if he can get away from van Sant 's influence , it might do him a world of good Who is this director anyhow one of van Sant 's boy toys \? 
There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you You do n't need to tell the audience what to think , because they 'll see it The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support And he may have been right , it lacks a basic credibility 70s Edinburgh was n't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath From the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together , it 's all too contrived for my taste 
I still ca n't believe how bad this movie was If I was n't a massochist I do n't know if I would have survived the viewing It looks like it cost about 1000 to make , but it was n't the money that brought them down The acting was horrid not just bad , 3rd graders could have read the lines better Second , the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin , and that is sorely lacking in this flick We do n't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff br br Ahh well , better luck next time eh \? 
This movie was okay , but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way , especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman It almost seems as if Kate 's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch , making this film seem a little simplistic br br Also , as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda , it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots And there was no happy medium It was either Kate 's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her This is not typical of interactions between gay and non gay relatives and friends It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make Sadly , the movie showed none of these types of interactions For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance , it struck me as very intolerant movie ! Then at the end , Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory is that what being gay is really all about \? Come on ! 
This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen I'm not exaggerating , I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves The only thing interesting about this movie is the box On the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so I figured eh whatever , if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least wo n't be TOO bad , but after I saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about , it 's some nonsense from the early 1980 's that he made Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers br br ANYWAY , I think that they just liked the name Zodiac Killer , and did n't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac 's crimes or his MO , or even the years that he was active All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the stories about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac 's crimes did They also compare the Zodiac to Vampire of Dusseldorf Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz 's son quite often The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike , and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people , not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks None of the Haarman facts are correct either , just a bunch of jumbled nonsense His son even says Do n't forget , his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t 's His actual name just has one ! I think that the writer director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman Ooh those sound like cool names , let 's make a movie about them without doing any outside research ! great idea ! br br Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM IV and getting cured of it I was also diagnosed with DSM IV and have since recovered , etc For those of you who do n't know , DSM IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems ! Haha br br Anyway , my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list , and it 's rare that a movie ever reaches that point But , if you are interested in watching a totally non fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring , full of inexperienced actors , and not completely rational , I 'd say check out this movie br br Oh , and I liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice Nice touch 
An uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980 's This was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood Daphne Zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie \( she has also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II \) 
Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good But we were wrong First of the acting wow the acting was the worst , the effects were really bad as well , it seemed like a film a college kid made The plot was pretty good , but it 'd been done The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors The main guy was the worst actor ever it 's a shame I'm even calling him an actor The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny so if you want a good laugh see it but other than that stay far away from this one I usually love B list movies and such , but this one I do not know how it was passed to even be put on video this one is the worst I 've seen and I 've seen some bad ones 
This ca n't be Mandy Schaffer 's last film Somebody , do something ! \( br br Argh br br What little life this one might have had , the directing finished off Do n't blame the cast they did OK Even the winemaker 's younger brother was pretty well done , and he did n't even get into the movie until halfway through And please , please put Mandy in some more movies ! She 's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age Ya' breakin' my haht , heah br br Two specific criticisms , in case anyone cares \( apparently nobody liked this movie very much \) First , the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment , in order to see whatever she was supposed to see , and never got seen in return , was very annoying Hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives It 's dumb Write better scripts so you wo n't have to use that lame plot device any more If your script is n't good enough to stand up without that , then do n't produce it br br Second , Carmen would n't have fallen for that fake injury trick that Traci pulled She already had Traci fingered More bad writing directing there br br I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it Actually I did n't hate it as much as the others seem to have It just did n't have much of a reason for being made , unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely Mandy Oh , and to whoever did n't think she was sexy the character was n't very well written , but how can you say she was n't sexy \? ! \? One or the other of us needs glasses , and I do n't think it 's me br br MORE MANDY \( Not to be confused with Moore , Mandy although I 'd like to see her again too \) br br P S Did I mention I hope Mandy makes me more movies \?

Following the release of Cube 2 Hypercube \( 2003 \) , and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube \( 1998 \) , Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy , the prequel Cube Zero br br Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution , time and place unknown , two low ranking operators , Wynn \( Zachary Bennett \) and Dodd \( David Huband \) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers , some of which are rigged with death traps Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection , these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn , a mathematical genius , discovers that one of the prisoners , a woman named Cassandra \( Stephanie Moore \) never agreed to be put inside the Cube Suddenly it 's realized that perhaps their jobs are not what they seem , and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted br br For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube , this prequel will probably not be to your liking It 's not that the story does not have potential it 's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on Standing alone , it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message It was also nicely self contained The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original , attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing br br What this new film has to offer , which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil , certainly are good questions to be raised , but probably should have been done so on their own merits , rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations br br Having said this , the other traits of the film , such as acting and direction and writing , are not awful There is a bleak , dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City' , and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube Unfortunately for Barbarash , these are not enough positive qualities to save it 
I have been known to fall asleep during films , but this is usually due to a combination of things including , really tired , being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish The plot development was constant Constantly slow and boring Things seemed to happen , but with no explanation of what was causing them or why I admit , I may have missed part of the film , but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else I cant recommend this film at all 
I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson 's trilogy came out , but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison The pace of this movie is rushed , many important scenes from the book are left out , and there is little character development The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over , which I found distracting And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished There are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch , and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter Watch this one if you 're in a hurry and ca n't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy But if you have n't read the book you 'll probably be confused , because there is a lot missing from this version 4 out of 10 
Anyone who 's watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table So , when crazed Lara moves into Patti 's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers , I did n't even blink When Lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor Patti , and dares her to do anything about it , I just nodded You see , on Planet LMN , people do n't behave the way they do for any particular reason , they just do it to keep the action going Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers ! ! Poor Patti she just trusted too much , and Lara went off her medicine , and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone 's tummy , and a body bag going out the front door The horror ! br br But take it from me , this Planet LMN product is a classic You need to watch it once , just for the great laughs you 'll have On the Improbability Scale , I give this film a 95 100 Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices , too You 'll understand later 
I grew up watching and loving TNG I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD , which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode , as the difference in style and approach between the two shows could n't be more stark The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker 's character , which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY They could have featured memories that would be new to the audience , rather than simply regurgitating old show clips The in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as clich in the beginning , and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on Bar none worst episode ever 
My first review of 2010 is Into The Blue 2 The Reef The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef br br Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing A few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they ca n't escape otherwise they will be killed They were hired to find two big containers One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core br br The movie also has a back story about another person \( brother of the lead character \) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend , I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time , this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and was n't needed to be shown br br However apart from that , this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name None of the original actors or characters return , it has a dumb plot , stupid characters and a boring climax 
Mr Perlman gives a standout performance \( as usual \) Sadly , he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces br br Larsen is in Die Hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles , I'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part br br The lovely Erika is very decorative \( even though fully clothed ! \) and shows some signs of getting acting at last br br SFX are mainly poor CGI and steals from other movies br br The shootouts are pitiful worthy of the A Team br br Not even worth seeing for Perlman AVOID
Yet ANOTHER movie about a group of less than intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short cut or , in this case , to visit a run down side show attraction The results , as expected , are not at all good , as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic , in bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before The father , who is apparently a professionally photographer , just HAS to stop and take pictures of the place , only to find that it still inhabited The various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions , only to be scared away Thinking they made it safely on their way , the van tire explodes \( surprise ! \) , leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town , which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks \( surprise ! \) br br This film plays out as expected , with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks There is some fighting back on the families part , but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film , as they are badly executed There is nothing remotely original here , unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film The acting is about as bad as I have seen in quite some time by everyone involved \( it is pretty bad when your cast is out acted by the cast of Camp Blood \) The special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television br br Still , though , despite all the negatives , I somewhat enjoyed this film It definitely has a so bad it 's good vibe to it I made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once I got past the ridiculously clich d plot , terrible acting , and cheesy special effects Though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry , particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless br br Bottom line , I can list countless films that if you have seen them , you have seen this The difference is most of those film are better Though not a complete waste , this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary br br My Grade D
I am a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson , but this movie is horrible At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever So , of course , Brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film Now I know why they do n't make big budget porn movies anymore In a fantasy world , porn stars could act , but this is the real world and they ca n't act That 's why there porn stars , if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act , then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn Just because your beautiful does n't make you a movie star A fine example of this is Traci Lords , when she was a teen thru her 20 's she was one of the most beautiful , sexy women on earth She made her move into low budget mainstream films and could n't act Where is she now \? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot , but there are better movies she has made then Dream Quest Come on Jenna , we do n't want to hear you talk , as much as we want to see you have sex Also , you Jenna , would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film 
No , just kidding It was God awful br br I was watching my local Sci fi station last night , which plays movies , every night , within a monthly theme This month it 's Space Turkeys , Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bombs Movies so bad , they should never have been made This was a good selection br br Everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions , the gore make up \( which showed potential \) and the editing \( which slightly out did the rest of the movie , in terms of being horrible \) The acting is horrible all around , the dialog is horrible , the script , the direction It 's not a good movie br br It consists of two forms of special effects , gore and stock footage of space I 'll focus on the gore Watching this movie , I thought to myself , What WAS the motivation behind the making of this movie \? People like making stuff , sure , but I was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the Make up Effects guy 's Demo Reel He \( Rick Baker \) actually went on to a pretty nice career , he 's worked on STAR WARS \( 1977 \) , KING KONG \( 1976 \) , MEN IN BLACK \( 1996 \) , and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN \( 1981 \) , plus a number of other notable flicks Other than that , I ca n't say I 've ever actually SEEN a real , live melting man incredible , or otherwise but I 'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one br br Now , when I think of bad editing , I usually think of maybe a scene where someone 's talking on the phone and then , in the middle of the scene , the phone jumps down to his shoulder , or something to that effect This movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms Specifically , over long and utterly useless scenes Just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have , from a little bit of dead air to that crazy long screaming scene with Cleaver Girl And that severed head in the river , the head gets thrown into a river \( in slow motion \) , the movie carries on for a couple minutes , and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall While I'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head , WHAT THE HELL \? \? br br Lastly , I 'll mention the running fat lady slow motion scene right near the beginning The jerky slow motion tells me that they did n't shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it was n't working like that and then slowed it down Oy vey In any event , if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed , glass door all in slow motion , mind you remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN , for this is where it all started br br Movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends This one 's a little slow most of the time but that 's just all the more time to come up with your own one liners It 's not the worst of the worst but it 's pretty freaking bad 
This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother wife by moving to Genova , Italy br br The plot of Genova sounds promising , but unfortunately it is empty and without focus The film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family , such as swimming , taking piano lessons or cooking eggs Most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome , completely failing to engage viewers emotionally The ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular , moving or emotional I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by Genova The only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova Genova can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city , but not as a film to be enjoyed 
This is one of the worst films I 've ever seen I looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel , and I wish I had n't I turned it off after a little less than an hour , though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes I wish I had It disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes \( which would be impossible \) I would in no way recommend this Its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century I do n't think , as many people say that it is , that The Bell Jar is necessarily unfilmable , but this particular rendition could have been done without I 'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice 
Please ! Do not waste any money on this movie It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids I could n't finish watching it , and usually I like watching all kinds of B movies How on earth could they find a distributor for it \? ! ! ! Funny however Check out Wikipedia for dark area The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind Maybe he got loads of money from the producers Money that should have been spend on actors , camera and editing Even that would n't have helped , since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film Unfortunately dark area has already gotten too much attention Please , director , producer and author of this movie , STOP making movies like that you are not doing yourself a favor The world would be a better place without this film 
I do n't want to go off on a rant here , but this is the worst film I 've ever seen Worse than The Avengers Incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout Shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun Gun The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut It 's not even bad enough to be funny It 's just bad BTW , the packaging is intentionally misleading br br Lion 's Gate owes me 4 00 
This was an absolutely terrible movie Do n't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside Both are great actors , but this must simply be their worst role in history Even their great acting could not redeem this movie 's ridiculous storyline This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony , and her pseudo love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning I am disappointed that there are movies like this , ruining actor 's like Christopher Walken 's good name I could barely sit through it 
Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film Bad mistake I 've seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it 's awful in almost every way editing , pacing , storyline , 'acting , ' soundtrack \( the film 's only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times \) The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is Harvey Keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort One for Keitel obsessives only 
there was some truth to this movie I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse \( or some such charge \) I'm not sure if it was in Australia The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever , as someone claimed , I ca n't be that generous Put it this way , I would n't bother watching it again 
1st watched 12 7 2002 3 out of 10 \( Dir Steve Purcell \) Typical Mary Kate Ashley fare with a few more kisses It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about \( I guess \) Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about way into the movie when it 's finally revealed why they are getting fired , then re hired , then fired again , then re hired again This is definetly made by people who do n't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it Maybe the real world will be their next adventure \( if there is one \) Even my kids did n't seem to care for this boring `adventure' in the make believe Let 's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults We 'll see what happens then

With an absolutely amazing cast and crew , this might have been a classic Instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted , rather pointlessly , on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960 Many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach , for instance , or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top John Huston Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well , in their very different ways , though br br The photography is gorgeous , but does not justify an hour and a half of your life , or the price of the DVD purchase 
The Confidential part was meant to piggy back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name , while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline Congressional investigations of the day However , despite the A grade B movie cast and some good script ideas , the movie plods along for some 73 minutes It 's a cheap jack production all the way What 's needed to off set the poor production values is some imagination , especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow A few daylight location shots , for example , would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick ear material , but Salkow treats it as just another pay day exercise Too bad that Brian Keith 's typical low key style does n't work here , coming across as merely wooden and lethargic , at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr goes over the top as a wild eyed drunk Clearly , Salkow is no actor 's director But , you 've got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication Too bad , she was n't in charge My advice skip it , unless you 're into ridiculous bar girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait jacketed 50 's fashion 
I absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film The humor seems to be destined for corpses It 's slow The story is too simple to be true The characters do not raise much sympathy , a few non important characters aside Nothing surprising happens What did the writers of this script think \? Oooo funny ! Let 's make some old lady 's high on pot ! Let 's make them giggle ! Let 's make them behave like little children ! ! Oooo , yes , that 's absolutely brilliant and original ! br br This film has irritated me most from all the films I 've seen in the last five years 
With a movie called Gayniggers from Outer Space how could you go wrong \? Just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters , use the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack , and throw in tons of gay gags Plot is unimportant Too bad , this film does n't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot The characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger , one or two jokes work , the rest fails br br The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the film My expectation were to high apparently 
watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home br br That in itself sounds boring Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left , it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home br br I must be missing something I'm a great fan of war films if they are done well This had jarhead syndrome A film that at times was beautifully shot , but cinematography does n't stop it from being totally dull and pointless br br And get over the slow mo cartridges coming out of the gun shot already they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it br br I did n't have any empathy for the main guy in it , i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die In fact the film would have worked much better if he had br br I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it , and everyone else loved it I have never been in the forces , and I'm with them It 's pretentious drivel the 3 stars are for the cinematography 
Here 's the good news first Spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release The artwork and effects are revolutionary , and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone br br And now for the bad news I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it You may remember that Spirit got badly trounced by Lilo and Stitch last summer The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more well established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled Why 'Lilo and Stitch' 's Script Did n't Stink br br For all the incredible new animation technology on display in Spirit , the story is almost astonishingly dull There is a lesson here , and \( needless to say \) it does n't just apply to animated movies You can have the most mind blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal , but if your story is boring and , more importantly , we do n't care about your characters , it 's bad film making Simple as that The animation is still mind blowing I just ca n't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it 
I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent !

'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multi ethnic Britain , rather like 'Bend it Like Beckham' , or more closely , 'East is East' , with which it shares a 1970s setting The tone is resolutely chirpy \( in spite of the dour Black Country accents \) , but the film lacks 'East is East 's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite Moreover , the portrayal of the film 's central relationship , between an Asian girl and her white friend , is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it I have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer , this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced , but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story 'East is East' was fun and sharp 'Anita and Me' seems obvious and dull in comparison 
Two old men sitting on a park bench I don`t really have a problem with this scene Only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie br br Yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this They also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese One is Nat Moyer who is Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black Let me see now , a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine Well I guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the Jewish stereotype \? Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths \? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s br br Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows Walter Matthau sleepwalks through his role as Nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
The filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories , so filming of the Israeli side dominated I was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair With such completely different viewpoints , any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds The word peace did not have the same meaning to each of them Peace to the Palestinian was freedom Peace to the Israeli was security With such an abyss , is this sort of film really worth much \? I finished with the feeling that I had watched pointless propaganda both sides were unconvincing

A lot of energy and that 's all br br FYI during one of the chase sequences , Fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds \( wow , what are the odds of that \? \) And , shortly after this , he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted As a result , the five is now on the back of Fatty 's shirt and he looks like a regular participant HOWEVER , the number SHOULD have appeared backwards on Fatty 's shirt but came out front ways a mistake , as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards 5 
Simply put , this is a simplistic and one dimensional film The title , The Rise to Evil , should tell you that this is n't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitler 's character Rather , from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background , we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian , seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil \? Ultimately , making him such a one dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing \( one must ask how the inept , phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time 's man of the year \) This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century , and try to delve into his mind Instead , it basically just says , Hey ! Hitler was evil ! Just thought you might like to know over and over again The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character Give me a break 
Ho hum An inventor 's \( Horst Buchholz \) deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands Unknowingly his son \( Luke Perry \) has been working on the antedote all along Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins Also in the cast are Tom Conti , Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts Perry fans will be accepting d'Abo is wrong for the role , but nice to look at

The Second Renaissance , part 1 let 's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans It all starts of with a single case , in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well , while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want br br Although an interesting premise , the story gets really silly from then on with \( violent ! \) riots between the robots and mankind Somehow it does n't seem right , as another reviewer points it , it 's all a little too clever br br The animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix \( in particular Osiris \) work for the best As for Second Renaissance Part 1 , I 'd say it 's too violent and too silly 4 10 
Pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films , it 's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second By concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube , it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube , as we simply do n't care about the characters inside Much of the film is simply boring , and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass eyed superior and the green eyed crazy marine After that , though , it just descends into over the top unintentional hilarity The ending is fitting though , tying it back into the first one in an indirect way The script is terrible , the acting mediocre at best , and the direction unimpressive A much lesser follow up 
This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well , then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects For example , in the original , one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds , listening in terror to the noises outside their room Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her Nell then looks across at Theo , who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand In the latest version , Nell is lying alone in bed , when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened And can anybody explain what Nell 's final words mean It 's about family It 's always been about family \? br br The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor 's performance , but even this cannot save the film Catherine Zeta Jones demonstrates once again that , beneath her pretty exterior , there is little depth In the original , Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion Zeta Jones , however has to spell it out , for example , by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend br br Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard 
To be honest , I did n't like Executive Decision which was obvious the template very much , but compared to this piece of crap , it looks like a masterpiece of art br br Not only that the people moving in the film \( the term actors would be an insult for all other actors \) should attend more acting classes , the guy who build the setting has n't even seen an aircraft from afar It is so ridiculous , that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard , but this is only the tip of the iceberg The film is full of illogicalness \( e g use sleeping gas , then do n't use it , then use it anyway \) , which dropped my rating finally to the bottom br br You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk

Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV No futher forward \? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood \? Could still be any horror film you say Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE \( aka CUBBYHOUSE \) and do you understand what the above exercise is about \? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made
This is n't art , it 's inner urban , politically correct propaganda ! Jindabyne 's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable it does n't see people as individuals , but rather , as members of categories br br This is the most patronisingly offensive Australian movie I can recall ever \( and it 's up against some pretty stiff competition ! \) A message movie , every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there Aborigines are victims white men are violent or alcoholics white women are n't that bad particularly if they are lesbians but they 're most likely of a depressive nature br br Four men who go away fishing , find the body of a murdered woman \( Aboriginal , naturally \) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout It 's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion , as if the men are animals The one man who briefly demurs is the goodie we know this because he 's living with a bisexual woman he likes to hold his baby a lot and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location \( away from all these beastly bush dwellers \) br br This is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within It 's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt The film is shot through with long distance views of the bush backed by foreboding , mysterious music It 's made very clear by the end that Aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape It concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black white reconciliation br br In Jindabyne , country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other Australians br br This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the Government 's Film Finance Corporation It 's a product of the artsy set , that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects \( which are as detached from real life as possible \) , as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see It does n't matter if the film is a stinker , they still get paid br br Spare yourself from wasting time , avoid it like the plague More jaded social commentary than actual entertainment , this film deserves to pan ! 
It is such a strange movie , you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh athon Strange comes to mind again and again Shot amateurishly , acted even worse and the directions , maybe none The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit See it if you got time to kill But do n't , do n't even try to take it seriously Supposed to be a tribute to 'Porno holocaust ' , Since I have n't seen it , from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad Should have given it 1 10 , but it did give me a good laugh or two , so it gets a 3 Excessive gore , the only thing somebody worked on Stay away if you are squeamish , more gore than laughs Wonder if the makers had a laugh making it \? 
It has a great name , but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money , in fact the first 30 40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone br br And yet the producers \( Roberto Angel Salcedo \) calls him an actor , but i do n't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting ! ! period The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing br br For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it , but they did n't ! ! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad , i do n't buy it br br But hopefully this is as bad as it gets To make people accept those DVD 's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it , that might work out br br Maka
Somewhere , out there , there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made One 's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space , or one 's where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti This motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing I think it 's some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it 's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long , wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes Do n't get me wrong , this is about the 30th gay film I ve watched in the past 6 months and some of them \( most of them \) have been very formulmatic , predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time The best one so far was Beautiful Thing So , I watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered I thought Oh , no , its going to be creative sinny mah But I gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended I tossed the DVD in the trash Sorry I did n't like it and if you did , sorry if I offend 
This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen To begin , I 'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading , if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown , you are soooo wrong In fact the killers face does n't even slightly resemble the front cover , it 's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool , there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods , then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it 's young in a glisten of sunlight I mean seriously WTF \? \? \? How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through \? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining , if it was n't horror then at least it would be funny right \? WRONG ! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S I C K br br Bottom line is Do n't SEE THIS FILM ! ! ! 
After spotting the high rating on IMDb , I decided to go see this movie Beyond that high rating , I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate , without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations br br Given my rating , you can see that I was disappointed I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room By the time Enslin entered the room , I was ready for some scary stuff br br First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded Enslin reacts in a believable manner He 's freaked out I'm encouraged and think to myself , this is going to be good The people who made this movie understand that less is more br br But it 's what happens next that was a big let down The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works Let 's see , a clock radio that turns on by itself \? Good , that 's always scary Objects that move around in the room \? Good , you ca n't complain about that Blood dripping from the walls and sink \? Great Ghosts that commit suicide \? Good Anything else \? How about loud noises , shaking , fire , more shaking , messing up the room , more blood , etc etc It 's all good And it 's all been done before Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession , and they wo n't be able to look away br br Well , it did n't work for me And you know what else \? When I go see a horror movie in a theater , it 's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments But this movie had no scary moments The audience was silent and disinterested I felt no chill down my spine Nothing The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be br br So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever \? Friends of the director \? Sorry , I just do n't get it 
I went to see this film with low expectations , but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film Sadly , that 's about all I got The story covers familiar territory \( the high school reunion \) , but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme Though the quality of the acting was good overall , the content of the film was appalling The sexism of the film was blatant women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married , procreating or both \( though this was couched as a post feminist choice \) Worse still was the racism the shrill Jewish mother , the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty \( tormenting the class geek \) We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo , and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen 
 54 is a film based on the infamous Studio 54 of the 1970s the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers In the film , Ryan Phillippe is the main character , based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 1982 br br The film 's problem is that it 's all glitter and style and no substance It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like Boogie Nights but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine snorting club owner Steve Rubell It 's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time , it 's a total failure br br 54 could have been insightful and interesting but instead it 's just another dumb teen flick that is n't entertaining or even remotely engaging View at your own peril 
It 's official , folks Hou Hsiao Hsien does n't have a thought in his pretty little head Are you wondering why he chose Shu Qi as his muse \? br br Shu \( or is that Qi \? \) does n't appear in this one Instead we get a snaggletoothed Yo Hitoto , apparently a pop star in Japan judging by her song at the end , she 's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at Rockin' Curry is a actriss and a wasted Tadanobu Asano , typically an indicator of quality , who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling Asian hipster and is too old to manage even that br br Hou 's philosophy \? Life is limbo , a big nothing , feel it and move on I 'd like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night , no , make that trains that pass in the day , never connecting , each hurtling to its own destination , usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they 're lucky Yikes Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied , technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film , which features about twelve actors conversing at machine gun speed for about ten straight minutes an impossible directorial feat get trapped making this laconic sub Jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now \? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight , but at least it has two great shots , shots that hint at Hou 's true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor His M O while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent You be the judge if that sounds appealing br br Hou does not need to refine you cannot refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai He needs to expand , to bloat outwards , to release the inner expressionist and genre revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clich d minimalism It 's time for him to do a live action remake of Akira or something This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe , ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster \( What is the connection between reality and people who ca n't talk \? It seems to me that people in real life never stop jabbering \) Then again , considering that 2005 alone brought big budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux , The Island , and King Kong , it 's now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou , and that 's really sad br br The good news is that , though Hou is in his 50s , it frankly feels to me as if he has n't even begun There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there , such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset red while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins But whatever fear is holding him back , however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema , Hou , your time as the darling of the Rotterdam , Venice , Toronto , Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double quick Two words for you Atom Egoyan Two more words , or maybe three Tsai Ming Liang You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever Risk your shirt on a sci fi epic , sell out , be reviled but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart Let your painterly talent express itself to the full You 're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise 
I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen !

Howling II \( 1985 \) was a complete 180 from the first film Whilst the first film was campy and creepy The second one was sleazy and cheesy The production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis' The scene from the first film was badly re created A skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' \( Reb Brown \) to the old country \( Romania \) to uncover the mystery to her sister 's murder transformation death Christopher Lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage guide to the two Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba , the head werewolf of the Romania She also suffers from a bad case of morning face , ewww ! br br Bad movie There 's nothing good about this stinker I'm surprise Philippe Mora directed this picture because he 's usually a good film maker The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it \( no , not the content but the film stock itself \) To round the movie off you get a lousy punk performance from a Damned wannabe Babel Maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could 've got the real deal instead of an imitation br br Best to avoid unless you 're desperate or you lost the remote and you 're too lazy to change the channel

It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels It 's where the first novel \( Dune , Ender 's Game \) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make The Matrix is finally the film equivalent The Matrix stands tall , alone , as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle Seeing this cash cow just sitting there , and wanting to explore other aspects of society , the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non action sequences in SciFi While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies , the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel Watch for eye candy , not for deep thought br br 4 out of 10 , as registered by this fine website 
Too bad , I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey But the director failed to put this together There 's a lot of action , a lot of promise , but it all comes off hokey The director did n't do his job Promising action comes off lame So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film This version of The Rage \( DirecTV credits it as 1996 \) simply is n't worth the time to watch it Another director would have done a better job

The movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of Joeseph Conrad 's Heart Of Darkness , the River is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama br br The claims made on the outside of the DVD box was overt fraud to br br take this fabricated death of a Journalist and present it as factual br br while some portions have Muslims supporting the 9 11 attacks for the USA 's treatment of Muslims around the world br br I alerted the Video store that the movie should be removed from their Documentary section and be placed in the War drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events 
This is one of the most irritating , nonsensical movies I 've ever had the misfortune to sit through Every time it started to look like it might be getting good , out come more sepia tone flashbacks , followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary The main character , Maddox , is a manipulative , would be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility The supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting , but are unfortunately never developed Nor do we ever really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion At one point , I thought Aha ! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton ! Now we 're getting somewhere ! but of course , that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless , both from Maddox 's perspective and the viewer 's Where 's Ferris Bueller when we need him \? 
Richard Pryor 's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow In his stand up , he jokes about it getting great laughs It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose The Toy is about the lamest he ever chose , aside from I guess Another You br br A movie where a white man buys his son a black man \? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing It 's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat , instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum ! At least Gleason had his moments Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff This is a waste of any movie watcher 's time ! 
My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD The first season was must see TV for us Unfortunately , the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching br br My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss Why would a strong , middle aged woman do those things \? The answer is she would n't Additionally , my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family Ca n't the script writers do something original from time to time \? As I mentioned , we are no longer viewers We prefer shows that do n't betray the characters and insult our intelligence 
Once in a while you get amazed over how BAD a film can be , and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap There is absolutely No talent included in this film from a crappy script , to a crappy story to crappy acting Amazing 
Just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better Murder , She Wrote , it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years I'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do , or simply remembered its star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show Van Dyke , who only had a decent career in the 1960s , never was much of an actor at all \( by his own admission \) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 He looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking His talentless real life son Barry , a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that did n't involve his father , plays his son in the series 
Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain ! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties This is a horrible film in every way Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video They would receive a D for this College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school Since this monstrosity was made by Professionals I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation I enjoy watching bad movies Like Plan 9 From Outer Space but , this thing does n't even fall into that category The script , acting , sound , and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood , blaxploitation , or 1970 's horror films After viewing this you get the feeling you 've wasted an hour and a half of your life 
It was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of Sherlock Holmes Apparently Matt Frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny His skull like face made for a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead remake , but as Sherlock Holmes he looks like a scarecrow Not only does Frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch , but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical Holmes overcoats that he is wearing Not only that , but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap So his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester Whatever the cap was made of , it looked very new and artificial Jeremy Brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits , but Brett did not have to dress up like Sherlock Holmes in order to look the part Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch Even in the full Holmes outfit , he does not carry himself like Sherlock Holmes br br Frewer 's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad Upper Crust British accent is painful to see and listen to To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum , he then sneers as if that were some kind of British trait When I started watching this I thought it might be a comedy featuring Wishbone , the Jack Russell Terrier I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone But sadly , there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better br br Not only does Frewer 's version of Sherlock Holmes never stop talking \( in that awfully artificial British nasal accent \) , but he is much to friendly and kind Frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to , and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production , they are trying to make a children 's version of Sherlock Holmes \( Wishbone was better at that , too \) that was kindler and gentler Whatever the point of Frewer 's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes , it is flatter than a pancake , and easily the worst version of Sherlock Holmes that I have ever seen \( including the previous worst , by Charlton Heston \) br br Overall , the tone of this film is awful It reminded me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder All the suspects over acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed Holmes and Watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie Even on Murder She Wrote there is less exposition br br This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files and it is miles below Columbo The awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer It is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes , especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett This movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of Little House on the Prairie The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help br br The only minor bright spot is Ken Walsh who plays Doctor Watson with some dignity Walsh does not ham it up compared to Frewer , and when he is often interviewing witnesses , his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible Unfortunately , the rest of the cast is amateurish , and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other \( to show they are suspicious \) is something that I had not seen in any modern movie 
 Spoilers contained br br I 'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific What I did n't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go What starts off as a typical cowboy indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about Honus \( Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss \) and Cresta \( Candice Bergen \) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason They then escape and both turn up \( separately \) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them So far so ordinary Then comes the ending After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they wo n't they get together storyline , the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and did n't resort to extreme gratuitous violence In some ways , Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry 's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending I did n't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents , I would recommend Elem Klimov 's Come and See 
This movie is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer , since about 1997 , seems to be best at hyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie I'm no film critic , but this movie was as predictable as they come Every attempt at a joke , every attempt at a touching moment , and the pitiful attempt at a love story , was exactly what I was predicting in my mind Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one 
In spite of having some exciting \( and daring \) sequences , NBTN just never gets going There are exploding boats , hat pin murders , mass suicides , pathologists with body parts , and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes , but they 're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition Everybody in the movie looks bored This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed br br Add to this the too proper Brit characters and you feel like you 've drifted into a Sherlock Holmes movie br br Finally , the cinematography is very ordinary There are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside , or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire , but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull br br Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans 
If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry \( Yash Raj \) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards br br If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil , Akshay , Saif and Kareena , then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations br br The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film That itself was a clear indicator of the director 's vision Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted Anil Kapoor 's gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie br br In short IT'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM I would say that even Aaja Nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this br br One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay 's love story After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically Only one song Falak Tak Chal is somehow good of all in the lot An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar br br Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location \( probably Ladakh \) In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car I am still thinking who wrote this br br If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved \? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan br br Dear Anil Kapoor Akshay Kumar , If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out As artists of such stature , you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie , the actors and the production house both 
Sadly , this is not 'the best British gore film since hellraiser' , though the DVD cover claims this , which is what tricked me into buying it It is , however , an homage to many of the great horrors of old , films from most notably the Amicus stable br br Cradle is shot on mini dv , which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie , can be done so much better Every scene , set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way \( standard key , fill , rear setup \) , which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece The gore content is , quite frankly , laughable From the opening shots where we see a man 's obviously foam rubber head torn apart , through to tacky cheap prop hammers , the creature effects and the terrible cg , there was nothing in there that impressed me at all br br The acting is abominable , from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf , via Dani Filth , the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last , and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs Look out for the 'Mental Asylum' a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside , and the most bizarre \( and not in a good way \) padded cell I have seen br br It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering \( nay , running \) away at any available opportunity I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running br br It does , however , mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth 's breasts , which I guess is one \( um , two \) things it has going for it Once that 's out of the way though , it is all downhill br br I 've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon , and I would love to believe them , but on this evidence I'm not likely to If you want a decent homage to Amicus , avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead br br Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2 Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever seen 
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings , but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role Leigh , playing bar band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood , constantly leans on older sis Georgia , an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold Perhaps due to her double duties as co producer on the film , Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she is n't credible as a singer and , even if this is intentional , gives herself far too much screen time at the microphone Probably hoping for a tour de force , Leigh is wire drawn and nervous and jagged however , we simply do not see any talent within this character \( Leigh is obviously a solid actress , but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her \) If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal , we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the \( small \) breaks that she does As it is , the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences , and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie 's bar performance with Georgia 's sold out arena show both singing the same song and it 's a sadly nuanced moment but really , what 's the point \? 1 2 from 
Jean Marc Barr \( Being Light , The big blue , Dogville \) has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy I might be wrong but I do n't think this movie 's part of the Dogma '95 manifesto , though it really looks like it I'm not really sure of what I think about this film All actors are good They deliver pretty good performances , especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean Marc Barr The story is somehow interesting But I do n't know , there 's something about the movie that I do n't like The sex scenes are way too long It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap I do n't know exactly where it stands Sure it 's not a bad movie , but I wo n't suggest people to see it neither I 'll tell them not to watch Just do as you want If you feel curious and you 're open minded , give it a try , you might like it 
This is easily one of the worst martial arts films I 've ever seen , and that 's saying something The chant of viva Chiba , viva Chiba is heard at the title , soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid , stupid The basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into Japan and one man vowels to stop them , of course that 's our man Sonny Chiba The Karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords A woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard , but what are her true intentions \? Let me say at this point who cares \? Soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment Sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills , end of story Oh yeah the woman was corrupt too Congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever br br As stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen What makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be Some have already mentioned the infamous American intro put into the film That 's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it 's beyond funny I would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70 's karate scene was at the time Watch as Aaron Banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student \( bad editing \) punching him in the throat But everything is badly done in this film Terrible unbelievable fights , fake I mean fake blood , bad acting , dubbing , wardrobe , and let 's not forget the story One man to take out an entire drug problem in a country \? I bet Fight after fight is laughable This was the 70 's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight , but Chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie Let 's see he kicks a gun in half , kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene , give me a break Not to mention the fact that it 's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it 's filmed so poorly One part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture OK As the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood , really fake blood Too say it looked poorly made is and understatement The acting is totally non existent in this film I do n't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good , but it was n't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor Was it my imagination or did they dub the Asian go go dancer with a black accent \? As expected from a 70 's wardrobe you 'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks Also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time \? Do n't try and hide it now The characters were stupid as well The pimp club owner 's one of whom is decked out in a Japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie Also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling It was very annoying br br Overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making That does n't mean that it 's not entertaining With a film made so poorly it 's hard not to laugh through most of this film , if you can stomach it This was an old favorite watch with my best friend If it was purely bad I would give one star , but the laughs it delivers bumps it up 4 out 10 
I'm at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this poppycock of a movie They had a pretty interesting idea , with the buried movie set , and that was it So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story There is the buried set , some wolf headed monster running amok , an amulet , and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is What I would have missed , had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase , some really bad C G I , some incredibly stupid dialog , more bad C G I , and the hero fighting paper cut outs Other than the original idea , this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities My mistake for continuing to watch MERK
Disney 's done it again The company that made Mr Magoo and George of the Jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based , and keeps none of the spirit of the original br br Inspector Gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one , and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then Now that that movie does exist , I was severely disappointed , even outraged br br First we have the characters br br Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon \( with well done special effects accompanying them \) , and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget , but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch br br Penny has little to do while she played a major role in the cartoon , discovering the crime and halting it , and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents , now she is simply introduced and then forgotten , although she does at least sneak into Claw 's base br br Claw is the movie 's version of Dr Claw , who was a rather sinister , raspy voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair , his face hidden from view , as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand , with no mystery behind the character br br Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie , but are rather insignificant to it br br Even small parts of the cartoon are n't spared in this butchering The famous expression Wowsers ! was mysteriously changed to Wowser , and Gadget 's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks br br There is even product endorsements everywhere Why is Yahoo ! advertised on a sign \? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M M 's or Skittles \? br br Fans of the cartoon will hate it , others might will likely find the movie below par , and when all is said and done , this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show 
A BDSM sub culture of Los Angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess , plainly a vanity piece for its top billed player , Celia Xavier , who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera , lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles , while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD ROMS , but when disaster befalls Mistress Vanessa , virtuous Celia , determined to unearth her sister 's vicious attacker , begins a new job as a sex slave at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party Two FBI field agents \( whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites \) , in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective , are assigned to investigate the crime , while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her Flaws in logic and continuity abound , such as a homicide being allocated to L A P D 's Operations South Bureau , a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post production editing and sound reproduction The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie 's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario One solid acting turn appears among this slag Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent 
I'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman I loved Evolution and who did n't like Ghostbusters \? From the trailer you already know that Uma 's character will get dumped by Luke 's So the build up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him But the pay off is just not there The shark tossing did manage to get a \( slight \) giggle but once again , it was all in the trailer br br No one does breathless quite like Uma and Luke is diet Owen on his good days If not for Riann Wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp This is a comedy , right \? br br It 's not awful it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge This could have been such a brilliant send up of Superhero movies and Feminism but fails on both counts Let 's see if Jason Reitman can salvage the family name 
I do n't'know maybe it 's because I'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much Too much love for the music , too much parties , too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters \( come on , it 's not so sad \) and the aspect of the city shown by the director Everything looks too fake to me the families , the relationships , the music , the happiness It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture I must be honest it did seduce me a little , but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music , sex and parties \? I'm not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea , profound sadness and STDs \? I liked the scene with Caridad 's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people 
A stuttering plot , uninteresting characters and sub par \( to say the least \) dialogue plagues this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget br br The characters are n't believable , in their motives , actions or their professed occupations The plot reads like a bad Dungeons and Dragons \( TM \) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields There are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author , at least , wincing br br Avoid it like the plague Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will have better acting , dialogue and plot Yuck 
The TV guide calls this movie a mystery What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents This is Bollywood at its best worst , I honestly cannot tell the difference Nauseatingly sweet , kitschy clich s on every level , story line , situations , dialog , music and choreography To put it bluntly , you must be a retard to enjoy it I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity , but there were times when I had to walk away from it , because I could not take it any more The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses br br 
I remember loving this show when I was a kid I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I 've seen It was ultra high tech for it 's time It could repel enemy fire , do all sorts of acrobatics in the air , and take down nearly anything in it 's way Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is The casts members are hardly compelling , there are a lot of cheesy moments , and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era br br Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider , except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car After watching a few episodes , I found myself utterly bored I do , however , love the theme music 
Baba Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life This is the movie which caused his downfall It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred Soon after its release , he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably Its a very bad movie with horrible acting , bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay Throughout the movie , Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba , first day first show in theatre The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission Sorry , I 'll not recommend this one to anyone 
Being a fan of silent films , I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time I was pretty disappointed br br As has been mentioned , the film seems to be one long , long , commercial for the Maxwell automobile br br Perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is , I may have enjoyed the film more But it got old very fast And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films , without lessening a viewer 's enjoyment , what was with the Mexican bandits \? I mean , they are chasing a car through the mountains , a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour , yet they ca n't catch up to it \? 
Another movie to suffer without an adventure to run , no enigma to solve Just an illness man , acting like an animal No a good reason to take this journey Pitt and Lewis are great actors magnificent Michelle Forbes but a weak David Duchovny performance 
The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes The ending was even worse Everyone kept dying , but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK ! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had , etc The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline The only reason I give this 3 10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors They needed better coaching They could have really made this an OK film , but the screenplay and acting failed miserably 
You , know , I can take the blood and the sex , but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in Someone get that girl some pasta before it 's too late ! br br And you know , it 's just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it 's ripping off br br I gave this one a 2 , just because it 's marginally better than Tobe Hooper 's CROCODILE 
This low grade Universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming DVD release but , intended as part of a collection of similar movies that I already had in my possession , I decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release Which is just as well , since the end result was not anything particularly special \( if decently atmospheric at that \) for starters , the plot is pretty weak even though in a way it anticipates the Vincent Price vehicle THEATRE OF BLOOD \( 1973 \) albeit without any of that film 's campy gusto What we have here , in fact , is a penniless sculptor \( Martin Kosleck \) whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat ! who , upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic Alan Napier 's vitriolic pen one time too many , decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river However , while contemplating just that action , he is anticipated by Rondo Hatton 's escaped killer dubbed The Creeper and , naturally enough , saves the poor guy 's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude ! Although it is supposedly set in the art circles of New York , all we really see at work is Kosleck and commercial painter Robert Lowery \( who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl Joan Shawlee over and over in banal poses how is that for art \? \) who , conveniently enough , is engaged to a rival art critic \( Virginia Grey \) of Napier 's ! Before long , the latter is discovered with his spine broken and Lowery is suspected but then investigating detective Bill Goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of Lowery 's work \( I did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed ! ! \) so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be ! In the meantime , Kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting Hatton 's uniquely craggy and recognizable visage which , needless to say , attracts the attention of the constantly visiting Grey \( we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column \) much to the chagrin of both artist and model Bafflingly , although The Creeper is fully aware of how Grey looks \( thanks to her aforementioned haunting of Kosleck 's flea bitten pad \) , he bumps off Shawlee who had by then become Goodwin 's girl ! in Lowery 's apartment and , overhearing Kosleck talking to \( you guessed it \) Grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police , sends the slow witted giant off his deep end even down to destroying his own now completed stony image Curiously enough , although this was Hatton 's penultimate film , his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet introducing ! 
Republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er Werecat genre The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents , something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc ends up dead Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer does n't know if he 's the killer or not br br Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer , he 's the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time \( just over an hour \) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it As good as the talk is , I just wished someone would do something When it finally did happen , in the closing minutes , it was too little too late br br Take a pass 
This film was very well advertised I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be , my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it Then I went and saw it , I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in , plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie ! I always go into a movie with an open mind , not trying to go into them with too many expectations , but this movie was not that funny Now it wasnt the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it , but for true comedy fans Id say pass Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead ! ! ! 
This film story is bad enough , which can happen in real life I'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film I say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if Madonna was rich and can do everything she want , then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 How can the story script is so weak \?

Okay , so I get it We 're supposed to be horrified The idea has been planted A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it Call me over the shock rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this But do n't expect me to watch a soft porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father' I mean has n't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape , and molestation' porn Horror is n't what your mind can fool you into believing It is what actually exists in film This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure

Well , that 's what I hoping I could say And 'hoping' was as good as it got This is an forgettable , so so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before , but I went in thinking it was my first viewing So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things , but like I said it 's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again Nightmare' is just another type of it 's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel Oh , please give me something that 's a bit more fresh It does n't have to be entirely original , but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J horror flick Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking , vengeful chick spirit br br But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old , same old story and jolts This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality While , the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it 's murky lighting The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood curdling experience , but really when it 's not trying to shock you I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut eye That might be harsh , but it just did n't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one , the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self centred bunch that you do n't really care what happens to them The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it 's just plain ludicrous The film 's haunting ending is a high point , though br br The film looks fine , although it could have done without the snazzy , quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood The performances tread a fine line , but Gyu ri Kim is strong in the lead role br br It 's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas , but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills Although , I found the handling of it rather lethargic , despite the odd effective chills A standard effort all round I guess , but still it 's equally missable 
'Chances Are' a big mistake to see You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him But I guess I have to disillusion you He made a really , really bad movie br br According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr , and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter , Mary Stuart Masterson \( complicated , huh \? \) br br They fall in love with each other Then appears Jr former wife , Cybill Shepherd , and Jr falls in love with her too I guess I do n't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil br br In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr 's on his worst He copies Michael J Fox br br After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she 's not suitable for acting in movies br br Anyway , there 's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as antidote to insomnia 
When anti bush jokes get really easy to do , a show like this had better make sure it has something extra When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they do n't have yet , it 's just plain nonsense Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly There 's also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who is n't really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all The democratic characters rarely give their names so it 's a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton br br The episodes have coherent stories but that 's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking 
I have n't seen this movie in a while , so I'm afraid I ca n't be very specific about details It did have some interesting points Ralph Bakshi 's attempt at an animated adaptation of J R R Tolkien 's masterpiece was a very ambitious project , so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production Therefore , not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy \( with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made \) , the film itself seems less than finished It seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed , but whether or not it 's intentional is hard to say The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone , especially the Orcs and the Nazgul Another problem , of course , is the huge gaps in the plot Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie , and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours \( the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does it in about twice that time \) Far too many important bits were left out \( and I do n't refer only to Tom Bombadil , which , I think , was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie \) And of course , the ending , which is completely sudden and out of place I'm not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to end the film there , or if he even had any idea where he 's going to end it br br The characters well , most of them were okay The hobbits do n't look so bad \( except for the gay Sam Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character \? \) If you 're a Tolkien fanatic \( like me \) , watch this movie \( though I'm not too sure about buying it What special features does the DVD version have , anyway \? \) But know in advance that you 're not going to watch a real 'Lord Of The Rings Movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity , which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the Beatles carried on with their plan \( I actually think a psychedelic LOTR could have been quite cool The idea was to cast George as Gandalf , Paul as Frodo , Ringo as Sam and John as Gollum \) If you did n't read the book or did n't like it much or do n't like animation films or do n't want to see a half finished movie stay away 
With Knightly and O'Tool as the leads , this film had good possibilities , and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly , maybe some tension But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants It was of course totally superficial , beautiful English country and seaside or not The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film , when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older , instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast , and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements 
 National Treasure \( 2004 \) is a thoroughly misguided hodge podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich that has ever been written The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates \( how precious is that , I ask you \? \) a seemingly normal fellow who , for no other reason than being of a lineage of like minded misguided fortune hunters , decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably \( unintentionally \) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot , the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane , but disconnected misadventures br br The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king 's ransom someplace on native soil , and then , going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U S currency art work , is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining Could n't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country \? Hence , we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth Ben 's intentions are noble if confusing He 's set on protecting the treasure For who and when \? your guess is as good as mine br br But there are a few problems with Ben 's crusade First up , his friend , Ian Holmes \( Sean Bean \) decides that he ca n't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives \( oh , yeah brilliant idea ! \) Presumably , the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune So Ian tries to kill Ben The assassination attempt is , of course , unsuccessful , if overly melodramatic It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up , and pick on , the very sultry curator of the archives , Abigail Chase \( Diane Kruger \) She thinks Ben is clearly a nut at least at the beginning But true to action romance form , Abby 's resolve melts quicker than you can say , is that the Hope Diamond \? The film moves into full X File ish mode , as the FBI , mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft , retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive Honestly , do n't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct \? In the final analysis , National Treasure is n't great film making , so much as it 's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies , woven together from scraps , the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush br br The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors , natural flesh tones , solid blacks and clean whites The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements The audio is 5 1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made If only , as an audience , we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co were chasing after an illusive treasure , this might have been one good flick Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer , audio commentary and deleted scenes Not for the faint hearted just the thick headed 
Not that a film by Ulli Lommel filled me with hope , but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects , which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid The effect is never perfect , but it helps Unfiltered digital video really only works for the mockumentary style , because it never looks like anything other than video Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer It does not feel like watching a movie And what 's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker He ought to know better He ought to know that it 's virtually impossible to generate horror \( or even suspense ! \) on video For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties ! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business And lucky us , he wrote the script too ! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing , unjustified behavior , and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied Please , please miss this film You 'll thank me later 
This show is just annoying ! ! ! I feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny \( especially Bob Saget \) , the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the Awwww track comes up at the most unnecessary times The over dramatic kids are no exception , especially the Olsen twins Also , this show is clich city If you were to look up the word clich , it would read Full House Every story line has a life lesson to be learned at the end A sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness GASP too bad this could n't be possible in real life I do n't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track i find myself yelling at the TV saying , THAT Is n't FUNNY SAD CUTE If life were really like this , the world would fall apart 
 SPOILERS With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean , John Carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune , some 140 million dollars The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion There seemed to have been a mix up in the story when we later find out that it 's really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean 's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise br br The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia , Rodolfo Acosta Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura 's , Jeff Morrow Marry Anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond br br The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it 's revealed who the killer really is We then have what seems to be a double twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot br br Nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking There 's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S M sadism and of course double dealing and back stabbing not even counting murder You just could n't care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do br br Even the big surprise at the end is n't really that much of a surprise since the killer 's identity is divulged with the film maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! We then have a plot twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is The final plot twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie

Living in the Middle East \( in Israel \) , I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana Having seen the trailer , and being a thriller lover , I expected to see first of all a fast moving , breath catching movie , which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil , power and corruption , from a fresh angle Well , I almost left the movie in the middle The pace was painfully slow , almost all characters were stereotyped , the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult , but , as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review , in the end you do n't care Save your money , save your time , choose another movie br br Robi Chernitsky
This movie was so unrelentingly bad , I could hardly believe I was watching it The directing , editing , production , and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who do n't know all that much about movies There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense Big emotional moments and climaxes \( like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts \) and character relationships \( like one hinted at at the very beginning \) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film The characters are sadly underdeveloped , making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them The acting , surprisingly , is not entirely bad , but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances The film plays like a particularly bad T V western epic , and sadly diminishes the fascinating \( true \) story that it attempts to tell I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter That 's all very well , but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD No one is saying that the subject matter is n't good , just the quality of the movie itself Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans , but that does n't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good , because it was still bad A failure all around , though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at 
I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it The fat guy is the best character , as he seems to be a nice guy The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year 's attitudes and fads Phat Beach is also funny because the low budget babes in this movie are strictly home girls Most low budget movies have that local babe quality , and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over used , high mileage skank There were some cuties too That is the charm of these low budget crappy movies You will see a lot of doggies , and some real cuties ! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit Too bad It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a Where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return What happened \? \? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder what ever happened to X \? Anyhow , this movie mostly blows , but it has some funny moments 
So I finally saw the film My Left Foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is The central performance of Day Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing , but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less br br The fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable , and disability should n't obscure that I just wish that impartial onlookers would n't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable They do n't Acting out is normal , and so yes , disabled people act out but they do n't do it because they 're disabled they do it because they 're being unreasonable A physical impairment does n't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public , just because someone you love turns you down br br There are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able bodied Giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them \( Admittedly , I did once save a penalty from the school 's star striker with my face , but I already belonged by then It was n't for acceptance \) Engaging in a bar brawl is another Revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you 've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far All of these things are stupid , and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery does n't make them any less foolhardy br br So yes just because you 've overcome obstacles to achieve great things does n't make you any less of a jerk Being a good person takes priority setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list

I saw the film at the Belgrade Film Festival last week , and I'm still working off the trauma Essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh , sharp , deep , entertaining and promising Well acted too Natural My problem , however , is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning , nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp , grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken , toothless , bread chewing hags It 's rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME ! ! ! The festival brochure synopsis described only the \( utterly intriguing sounding \) first half hour a whore , piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar , pretending to be an advertising agent , genetic engineer , and petty government administration official , respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending gum smacking to come Serves me right for not reading the reviews , you might say but to my defense , a number of reviews I looked at post fact um did n't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film br br The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director \( a bashful , tousle haired Russian youth \) who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium \( the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically , and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening , though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come , judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour , and many exasperated comments on exit \) to say the following 'Well , I um , thank you very much for coming to see this film , and I just wanted to say well , it 's a very long film it took me four years to make it , and it 's I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it It is very long Thank you for coming ' This is what he said Alarm bells should have been ringing 'What 's he talking about \? ' I thought in happy confusion 'This is gonna be fun ! ' Of course , by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me , it was far too late to get out All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again And in the end I ca n't say I feel in any way improved by the experience Yes , I absolutely loved the first half hour It was intelligent , new , and had a lot to say And yes , Russia is probably in a bad state Yes , every society has many hidden faces Yes , toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard Yes yes yes I get all of this Really I do But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out , and so painful to bear If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging , try the Korean Chinese Bin Jip \( 3 Iron \) It 's artsy and surprising , but also to the point and fun 
Twenty years ago , the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later On the present days , Michael \( Gordon Currie \) invites his girlfriend Peg \( Stacy Grant \) and his best friends Chris \( Myc Agnew \) , Jennifer \( Emmanuelle Vaugier \) , Lisa Ann \( Kelly Benson \) , Ned \( Brendon Beiser \) , Mitch Maldive \( Phillip Rhys \) and Trish \( Rachel Hayward \) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear , and together with his Indian friend Crow \( Byron Chief Moon \) , they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty \( Jon Fedele \) that would eliminate their fears forever The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father , but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father , killing his friends br br The Fear Resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows , but in a messy screenplay full of clich s There are some exaggerated performances , like for example Ms Betsy Palmer others very weak , but in general the acting is good Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further , in spite of being surrounded by close friends , the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies The low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation In the very end , Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time The special effects are very reasonable for a B movie My vote is four br br Title \( Brazil \) Fear 2 Uma Noite de Halloween \( Fear 2 One Night of Halloween \)

Is this the same Kim Ki Duk who directed the poignant , life spanning testimonial of Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter and Spring \? The same Kim Ki Duk who directed the exquisite , nearly silent , heartbreaking longing of 3 Iron \? The same Kim Ki Duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of The Coast Guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all \( characters and viewers alike \) to experience redemption in Samaritan Girl \? I just cannot seem to find him in this film br br Oh , sure , Kim 's nature motif is still present The film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters Yes , it 's Kim Ki Duk , all right Kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the DVD 's special features But I'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation br br What is beautiful about angry , potty mouthed prostitutes , lustful , violent and potty mouthed fishermen , a covetous mute merchant , explicit animal torture , sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality \? These are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film If it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater , this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material It has been favorably compared to Audition by Japanese director Takashi Miike \( much to Kim 's satisfaction \) , but aside from some astonishingly good performances , especially given what they had to work with , by lead actors Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk , I find little reason to recommend this film I have not seen Audition , but I doubt it would alter in any way my view of The Isle Its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic Its sex is not pornographic , but passionless and masochistic Characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot Its point is either non existent or , I will admit , lost amidst Korean cultural quirks that I fail to understand br br The only beauty is in the cinematography , which is classic Kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake , mountainous terrain dominating the background , and an imaginative and playful use of color At times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big Kim Ki Duk romper room Some touches , like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by Jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes , are intriguing But as a film , this effort is downright confusing and , in the end , offensive to the senses , not necessarily to sensibilities One hopes that Kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past , for we know he is capable of so much more 
Recap According to legend , the Valkyrie Brunhilda defied Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire Only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames , free Brunhilda and release her from Odin 's claim , and have her for himself Now , war is brewing in the Norse lands , and the King needs an alliance with the Berserkers The Berserkers are warriors claimed by Odin 's valkyries , lusting for war , blood and flesh , and therefore outcasts , but superior in battle The leader of the Berserkers is a scorned son of the King , Boar , and his price for the alliance is his brother , the future king , Barek But after the King is victorious in battle , he refuses to give up his only remaining son , breaking his oath to Boar and betray him and kill him Boar is saved only by Barek 's call upon Odin But this is only the start of the battle between the brothers , and their final battle is about to start now , a millennia later br br Comments I had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some Viking ground , far too little quality movie about Viking has been done It started out very good too , with detailed longships and armors , nice and fitting sceneries and an OK battle br br The foundation in the Aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me Odin is much more vengeful , spiteful and absent than I remind him from school , and the valkyries has been turned into some vampire demons I'm no expert , but that seems outright wrong br br But the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the time setting from the original time period to today If the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time , with some decent battles , this movie would have been much better Now the setting , suddenly is changed to present day Stockholm Still , Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers for Brunhilda and Barek which gives silly scenes when armor clad and painted berserkers swordfights with Barek among the industries Beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement And when allowed to focus upon single fights , instead of massive battles as in the beginning , I quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy br br The end result is thin story , sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly , and the only that could save it , the action , is drawn from slow , dull and clumsy swordfights It draws very little from Aesir myth or Viking tradition Thus both story and action fails , and the movie is just plain bad br br Finally , as a Swede , this movie is a little confusing Supposedly filmed entirely in South Africa , it still contains some familiar Swedish signs , plates and what seems to be an authentic police car However , the effort is poor and only goes so far , as to really set it in Sweden No names are Swedish \( perhaps with Anya as the exception \) , no familiar sceneries are Swedish , they \( supposedly \) speak a little \( ancient \? \) Norwegian , not Swedish And uniforms , both police and medical , are clearly not Swedish If they were not going to even try to do it correctly and really give the illusion that it is set in Sweden , why bother at all \? br br 4 10

For the big thinkers among us , The Intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from France that gives so called art films a bad name The story is something about a bitter old coot , Louis Trebor \( Michel Subor \) , who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant , but beyond that , I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing With no coherent storyline to boast of , the movie loses us early on , though I'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film br br This muddled , snail paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits 
Revolt of the Zombies starts with Armand Louque \( Dean Jagger \) trying to convince General Duval \( George Cleveland \) that his mate Tsiang \( William Crowell \) is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies \( a bit like the people I work with really \) Anyway , Tsiang is murdered by Colonel Mazovia \( Roy D'Arcy \) but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies An expedition has been set up by General Duval to hunt for the secret since Tsiang ai n't going to tell them much anymore General Duval heads the expedition along with his daughter Claire \( Dorothy Stone \) who is engaged to Louque who also comes along During the expedition Claire dumps Louque for his mate Clifford Grayson \( Robert Noland \) at which Louque is n't too pleased about In a way that could only happen in a film Louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on Claire Clifford Co written directed by Victor Halperin Revolt of the Zombies has a bad reputation after watching it I can see why The script by Halperin , Howard Higgin Rollo Lloyd all uncredited , has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull as exciting as watching paint dry Nothing much happens for ages then nothing much happens afterwards either How Halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie , these zombies are just brainwashed people filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before George A Romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in Night of the Living Dead \( 1968 \) At only about an hour in length Revolt of the Zombies still feels too long Technically the film is OK considering it was made 70 years ago , the black white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location The acting is wooden largely unimpressive Revolt of the Zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it has n't dated well in 2005 it 's an absolute chore to sit through I believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap DVD compilations budget labels , but it 's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for 
I think scarecrows are creepy , so it 's a pity this movie does n't make more of them br br A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive \( when they move \) On the positive side , the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows It is as Alfred Hitchcock says , A bomb under a table goes off , and that 's surprise We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off , and that 's suspense 
Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series , Four For Venice is not only awful , but really awful So awful , that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash br br Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth , where Eva works as a waitress and Luis , an artist Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to London to do something related to his artwork , but the fact is , he is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another br br The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy It not only look senseless , but also draggy In the film , Nick try to seek help for several ways , but it ends to no avail It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons , or they are just simply dumb br br The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense , no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem br br It fails so bad , that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film 
I 've barely just made it through one episode \( Crouch End \) The dialog was stilted and down right cringe worthy The acting was tragic Eion Bailey , despite his best attempts to be dramatic , remains mostly expressionless His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie The characters were cartoons , each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random , meandering plot Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising , but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story If I had to compare it 's overall quality to something else , I 'd put this episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes on par with the NBC 's Hercules 
Oh dear ! What a disappointment I 've been watching old Westerns on British TV for decades , and I was n't aware of this one until its showing yesterday most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again br br The rich colour and outdoor sets were good , but that 's all I can say about this film I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made Several times I felt like turning it off , and finally I did , halfway through , something I hardly ever do br br Scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls , his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the Mexican bandit lad And I 've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern , not that this has bothered makers of many other Westerns br br Perhaps it got better in the second half , but I could n't be bothered to wait and see 
I really did n't have high expectations and I must admit that I was n't disappointed This movie is so terrible that I felt obligated to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time The storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse \? YES , it can ! somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back !

I did not think this movie was worth anything bad script , bad acting except for Janine Turner , no fantasy , stupid plot , dumb ass husband and unfair divorce settings If you have never seen this movie before do n't even bother it 's not worth it at all The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner , did a good job acting Terry 's husband is a stuck up smart ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off He think he is so smart but he is really just a nut Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her Nice girl huh Yeah she 's a real peach , not She 's no day at the beach either 
Going into a movie like I this , I was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills what I got was even less br br Christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit Horrified , he runs up the stairs and cuts himself The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe cept for the fact he 's obsessed with Santa After his boss makes fun of him he goes insane , dressing up like santa and starts killing non santa believing patrons and his boss An unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they 're about to torch him , he drives his van off a cliff into the moon Not the best ending I 've seen but it was original br br It was a slow paced , boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when Harry went apeshyt on the church goers There was hardly any gore and even the sex scenes were toned down br br Too boring 4 out of 10
TV does influence society just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted Besides , real people who look as good as these people do do n't have any problems br br Besides , does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living \? NBC just loves to insult the viewer 's intelligence , even if they 're just around Gump 's level I know a person who makes 100 , 000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs 2200 a month in rent br br I 'd like to see a show called Phriends , where it 's six ugly nobodies in dead end jobs , living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week and then the landlord jacks up the rent Now THAT I would watch 
Fashionably fragmented , yet infuriatingly half realized character study , an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates a talented but undisciplined star basketball player , and a pot smoking , womanizing rabble rouser We never learn why these young men are friends They may share confusions about the world and their places in it , but they do n't seem to have anything else in common Making his directorial debut , Jack Nicholson who also co wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner , based upon Larner 's book does n't introduce us to the characters with any clarity , nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen There are some very decent performances here \( particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role \) , but most of the picture is unformed \( perhaps intentionally \) , sketchy or unsure Bruce Dern plays the hard driving basketball coach , Karen Black is the older , married lady Tepper is having an affair with , and Michael Margotta is Tepper 's wayward friend \( in an off putting , over the top performance \) Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor , preferring \( I assume \) to let the character interaction dominate the film 's tone his script is no help either , and as a result it is unclear whom we 're supposed to sympathize with Small , random moments do work \( a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black , Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm room , all of the scenes set on the court \) , however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess Hoping to juxtapose an all important b ball game with a sexual assault , Nicholson shows no style at his craft \( nor does he earn points for chutzpah , as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly \) When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors , one has to question his motives in doing so Perhaps if Drive , He Said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain , audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste Unfortunately , the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie 1 2 from 
The animation was good , the imagery was good , although not totally original , however , the story was too long , way too confusing , and over the top dramatic After about an hour I could n't wait to get it over with With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really was n't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies If you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it , but frankly , I 've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell Go rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice , you 'll get way more out of it 
David Lynch 's crude and crudely drawn take on South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich s about suburban middle class families The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises , the son and mother are permanently horrified , incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series br br Lynch is not famous for his comedies \( i e On the Air , aspects of Wild at Heart \) , and I am not particularly fond of comedies in general However , there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland which made me laugh out loud There are some clever bits of animated cinematography where Lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions \( which never really vary in Dumbland \) br br I believe Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight forward , if disturbing , animated comedy here Interestingly , he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor \( i e most Will Farrell films \) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross out humor While the blend does n't really work very well here , it is nothing if not Lynchian br br Worth seeing by Lynch fans 
I have seen many , many films from China and Hong Kong This is the worst No , the worst one was 'Unknown Pleasures' I watched 'Platform' yesterday evening and thought that Jia Zhang Ke 's other two films must be better This evening I was disappointed again I will not be watching 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow evening because I have just placed all three films in the bin ! Whoever gave this film , 'Platform' ten out of ten , needs to watch more cinema ! The photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work The storyline was so disjointed that I fast forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration I would not recommend this film to anyone Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day These are true masters of Chinese cinema , not pretentious con men ! 
People love the original story for its ending The Hollywood style ending made this 99 version of 'A Dog of Flanders' just for kids movie I did n't cry this time because the story was too Hollywood Japanese TV series are much better 
When great director actor combinations are talked about the team of J Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre Unfortunately Kinjite Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter br br That 's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better But for the life of me I do n't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl , a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out That might have been good for another film altogether , but it served no purpose here br br A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who 's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals That part could also have used a little explaining as well But he 's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl br br Bronson 's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper A stylish , murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history In fact in the film 's best scene , Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire br br At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack , he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone , but Bronson and Lopez I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez But that 's another terribly big hole in the plot br br Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez I wish the whole film had been better though This was the last film of the Bronson Thompson team and J Lee Thompson 's last as a director He should have gone out with something better 
This documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth Sadly , though , after priming us with this , the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non stop attack on Christianity , and pretty much focusing on the easy targets br br The writer director clearly has some issues with the Church \( he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger \) and this film seems to be his form of release It 'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded , but as a whole , the movie is disappointing 
Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN , made the same year , I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians There simply is not enough there Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously In any event , all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men , but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin 's tramp character His trademarks are childlike innocence , timidity of approach and a tendency to under react to calamity by looking perplexed , batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger The comedy in Langdon 's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or na ve ways or with a minimum of physicality , such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away , propping up a collapsing building with a two by four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him In this story , about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross country walking race to publicize a rival company 's footwear , he manages to win by sheer luck There is nothing here that has n't been done far better by the Big Three 
Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation \? Technically , I am a Boomer , though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the '60s were reading Marx , burning their draft cards , and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives I was still in grade school But I remember them well , and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools , who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br This is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up 
Worst Bob Hope comedy ever \( and that includes some heavy competition \) Hope , on an island with sailors , dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl steering his ship Somebody certainly steered this Hope hackery over the cliff , as it features Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still ca n't work up any laughs or excitement Where 's Bing Crosby when you really need him \? 
I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal 's graphic novel when it came out , and was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film , and even more so when I found that Bilal had directed it himself The film , however , was a major letdown The visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks , and the story is poorly told Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel , and he does n't do a very good job at it , either br br The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus They were both out of their right time and place , forced together by circumstance Most of all , they were funny and likable Not so here Nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever , and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid Even though the film is French , Horus does n't have to be ! br br We have all seen films we enjoyed , but would n't recommend to everyone , for some reason or other I would n't recommend Immortel to anyone , except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources Bilal 's a master storyteller , but obviously not a master of every visual medium 
Action , violence , sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie And everything they do is done without reason Mark L Lester is \( un \) known for his violent \( without reason \) movies \( Commando , The Base \) The story is weird but stupid The actors play their stupid characters very well I'm not telling they are stupid but I mean they are very bad actors It 's another low budget unknown B series action movie If you saw something like Operation Delta Force , Drive , The Patriot , Sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than Misbegotten do n't rent it and , by the way , do n't rent any of the movies I mentioned I give it 1and a half out of5 
So I had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic , tear jerking Barbra Streisand film Something like The Way We Were I was certainly wrong The chemistry between the two main characters , Esther Hoffman and her John Howard , was nonexistent , making it impossible to get attached to the characters There was n't anything romantic about it Streisand 's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who could n't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast forward button At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later There 's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who ca n't seem to realize it until he actually dies Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on , and I kept asking myself when it was going to end br br The death of John Howard was completely predictable There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie , and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever It was n't a tragic accident , it was him basically being an idiot Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard br br The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs The ending of the movie when she sings With One More Look At You Watch Closely Now was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3 10 Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger

It awfully seems so First of all , this is a noble premise that could 've been utilized well A rejected young nerd who grows up , stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high \? Ca n't say you had nothing to work with But this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers Everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike We know the pattern by now These stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute Let me ask you something Who , in their right mind , is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark , dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she 's all alone and surrounded by corpses \? Does that make any damn sense at all \? br br Valentine is only occasionally innovative One good shot involves the butchering of Denise Richards' character She gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw There 's some good songs in the soundtrack , including one cool track by Orgy The music video is contained in the special features section on the DVD br br Even the acting is mediocre at best The actors all sleep through their roles Of course , David Boreanaz is often stoic , even in his portrayal as the title character on Angel Denise Richards is a fine actress , though , and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie br br Valentine is just like you 'd expect pretentious , implausible , forgettable , cheesy and without a good scare in sight Do n't even bother br br My score 4 \( out of 10 \) 
 Her Cardboard Lover is Norma Shearer 's last movie She quit the movies and , I think , joined the Board of Directors at MGM That was a good move on her part Her Cardboard Lover was talky and boring in parts It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat br br The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman \( Norma Shearer \) hiring a man \( Robert Taylor \) to make her playboy fiancee \( George Sanders \) jealous I am surprised that the director , George Cukor , did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms Shearer and Mr Taylor Mr Cukor served Ms Shearer well in The Women but not in this movie br br The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor During Mr Taylor 's career , he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and When Ladies Meet in 1941 In 1942 , he gave his best comedy performance in Her Cardboard Lover and , up to then , his best dramatic performance in Johnny Eager He had a busy year I think of all the actors at MGM , Mr Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot Also , MGM gave Mr Taylor all types of movies to make most of them were successful That is why MGM kept him for 25 years br br Mr George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel He played a similar role eight years later in All About Eve for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role As for Ms Shearer , this was one of her worst performances , she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 , The Women , and gave her best performance It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in Her Cardboard Lover Also , it did n't help that some of her clothes were awful br br Too bad she and Mr Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together , the superb Escape The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie , Personal Property that Mr Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow It was too talky , boring , and the actress looked old Ms Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor , so in 1937 , she died at age 26 What a waste !

David Mamet 's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking man 's movie , a movie that makes you question everybody and everything I saw it for the first time recently and could n't understand what was supposed to be so great about it br br The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a best selling author Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient 's gambling debt to a shark named Mike \( played by Joe Mantegna , who is the only reason to watch this film \) She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her Intrigued , she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate \( she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book \) She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up br br I do n't feel like going into details , but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of 80 , 000 br br First of all , the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads Not only that , but the audience \( and the main character \) knows that they 're dealing with con men , so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned \? Besides , Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people , yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily and keep in mind , she knows full well that Mike is a con artist br br Secondly , we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning , yet in order for the con to ultimately work , she had to do several things that the con men could n't possibly have predicted that she would do First , she had to decide to help settle her patient 's debt , allowing her to meet the con men in the first place If she had n't done this , the entire con would have failed I just have to say that it 's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient 's gambling debt Not only that , but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up \? Did they simply show up at that bar every night , hoping she would come and see them \? Another thing that had to happen that could n't have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade What are the odds of this happening \? And yet the whole con is based on this premise br br Another problem I had is with the ending Margaret finds out she 's been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike At first , Mamet leads us to believe that she 's going to con the con , but that falls through , so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade Not only that , but she did n't even take back the money he stole from her br br Ultimately , the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled And if you , like me , predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned , you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying 
I 've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well , it surely was n't worth waiting all this time to see it THE INCUBUS is strictly by the number horror film unseen killer monster is raping and murdering women in a small town br br The film goes like this movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing \( surprising , huh \? \) blah blah blah , etc br br The film is totally predictable from beginning to end Even the stupid big red herring used throughout the movie would n't convince a 5 year old And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character , so when the shocking surprise ending arrived , I was n't shocked or surprised In fact , it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie It 's so silly ! br br Anyway , the film is so by the number that the rock band sequence is one of the few stand out moments in this dreary flick It 's a stand out scene not necessarily because it 's good but because it 's so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut , all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater 's washroom by the incubus The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography , which I actually liked But aside from that , there 's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS , except that it 's unintentionally hilarious 
METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set Released in 1990 , METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of The Atom Age Vampire , which also featured a scientist striving for similar results Set in modern times , METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie br br A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging Pressured by the administration to publish his papers and , produce some results \( or risk losing funding \) , the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig ! At first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects , he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner ! br br The acting is stilted and , the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film The score is pandering And , the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious it 's absurd it 's ridiculous at best br br As others noted , the end turns into a 30 minute gag , which is seemingly endless Without giving too much away , I 'd call this one , Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone 
Using footage pillaged from Planet of Dinosaurs this shot on video \( except for the stolen footage \) concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is do n't wait for it , is really earth Its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes Slightly better than Chickboxer \( another in the Bad Movie Police series \) having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects , this movie is still an impossible slog to get through I'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we 're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage \? Clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
No matter how you look at this movie , it is just awful br br If you view it as a horror , then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets br br If you look at it as a comedy , then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame br br If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B ch ! br br If you look at it as an action you ca n't really pull for the whiny hero br br As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre Critters looked pretty good , so did the Ghoulies , heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable The hero is a whiney security guard , his girlfriend is always complaining , they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend , and another friend who is a spaz At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes this movie is just utterly stupid I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum \( which is obviously not a club , but more likely a diner \) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 Give me a break , I am 25 and I look younger than any of them 
It 's the worst movie I 've ever seen The action is so unclear , work of cameras is so poor , actors are so affected and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen My advice from the bottom of my heart do n't watch it unless you like such a low class torture 
The infamous Ed Wood classic Plan 9 From Outer Space features an indignant alien calling the human race , stupid ! Stupid , stupid stupid ! I 'd have to say exhibit A in that trial would probably this movie , a ridiculously silly sci fi film br br Falling action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie , Luke , a former Universal Soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers While Van Damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels , he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the Universal Soldier series came around So , probably cursing under his breath the whole way , he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks You 'll find plenty of mindless violence , but I 'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing Otherwise , you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it 's over br br Luke is called into action against more Universal Soldiers after a really really REALLY evil computer named Seth \( makes HAL look like Ghandi \) turns all the other universal soldiers into evil , remorseless killers Of course this is what these things are programmed to do , but in this case they are killing their creators , not the enemy so that 's a problem br br I love the dumb logic of this movie Logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as Michael Jai White does to be in this movie Logic that dictates that the creator of Seth be a blue haired cyber stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than Old Faithful does steam Logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time br br The film also features a daughter in peril character , wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a Universal Soldier , and a romance so tacked on , I have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a GOOD thing And when this movie ends , it ends Not a minute after a gigantic towering finale style explosion are the credits running No epilogue , no where are they now , no final kiss , just explosion , hug , over Even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible br br While it 's no Plan 9 , US TR is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy Van Damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths Not to be seen on a serious stomach 
Although it 's an R rated movie , I really doubt that you 'll really enjoy it unless you 're a teenager br br Why \? Because there 's no real plot , no character development , no funny jokes br br The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks \( pretty nice ones I might add \) to feast your eyes on br br I really ca n't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it 's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them br br My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks , but you 're too shy to rent buy an erotic movie br br Gave it 1 10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2 10 for the nice chicks
Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers that be disowned this waste of celluloid the editing is el crapo , the plot is incredibly thin and stupid and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot I never thought I would feel sorry for Ralph Macchio making the decision to be in this thing , but I do and I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston , gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of film at least Mr Leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie and he comes out ahead there are actually copies of this thing with Mad 's beginning sequence still on it if you can locate one , grab it cuz it is probably worth something it 's the only thing about this movie that 's worth anything and a note to the folks at IMDb com there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone the makers spoiled it by themselves 
How , in the name of all that 's holy , did this film ever get distribution \? It looks as if it has been shot on someone 's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie And that 's all they do There is no plot , no tension , no characters , and not a lot of acting Just screaming and more screaming br br I gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened It does n't except for screaming , of course Odlly enough , the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of Every shot looks like every other shot middle distance , one angle , dull , dull , DULL br br It 's not so bad it 's good It 's just plain bad 
A missed train A wrong phone number An extra cup of coffee What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision \? Most people do n't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions br br Happenstance tells the story of the interrelations and cause and effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian folk It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater , with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned br br There 's a cheating husband , an illegal immigrant , a classic slacker , a pickpocket , a crazy grandmother , an annoying girlfriend , a selfish roommate , and a homeless man Audrey Tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist \( in the sense that she 's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film \) and normal girl who just ca n't seem to find the right rhythm in her life br br She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her What happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters Does the prediction come true \? The concept is good , but the storytelling is flimsy The connections from one event to the next are weak There 's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of Happenstance br br If you enjoy Audrey Tautou , then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film , but you 'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director 
An executive , very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life , meets a boy with down syndrome , escaped from a residence Both characters feel very alone , and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life With this argument , the somehow Amelie like atmosphere and the sentimental music , I did n't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie Anyway , as there were some interesting scenes \( the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy \) , and the interpretation of both actors , Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne , was very good , I decided to go on watching the movie The French cinema , in general , has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life , opposed to the more stereotyped American cinema But , because of that , it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending , with the impossible death of the boy , the charming tone , the happiness of the executive 's family , the cheap moral , the unbearable laughter of the daughters , the guy waving from heaven as Michael Landon Really nasty , in my humble opinion 
This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him His master scheme seems to back fire on him br br Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces , but is still the only reason to watch this thriller Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal , Mary Murphy , Eva Gabor and Jay Novello br br 
Judging by some of the comments in IMDB , I was expecting an action movie perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one , but essentially an action movie br br Whatever it is that I watched , it certainly did n't feel like a movie The story is simple and straightforward \( even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated \) Take three interest groups 1 \) the government 2 \) the rebels 3 \) a group of assassins br br Now subtract the first \( they never appear in the movie \) Then simply let one of the assassins , the princess , become a rogue on a revenge trip Add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience And you 've got the ingredients br br But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci Fi on a low budget , what you 're left with is a feeling of emptiness The movie just does not feel like a movie , but a weird , incoherent , boring dream br br Avoid br br 2 10
A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar , and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings She discovers that right before each ceremony , the bride was given a rare orchid \( supposedly from the groom \) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a Dr Lorenz , who lives in a secluded estate , with his wife In reality , Dr Lorenz is responsible for the crimes , by putting the brides in a suspended state , and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young Patricia , along with Dr Foster \( who is working with Dr Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife \) try to force Dr Lorenz 's hand by setting up a phony wedding , which eventually leads Patricia into the mad doctor 's clutches This movie had a very good opening reel , but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes The cast is decent , Walters and Coffin deserved better , but that 's life Russell steals the show \( even out hamming Lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances , even considering his Monograms \) as Countess Lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today 's Hollywood prima donnas Weak and contrived ending as well Rating , based on B movies , 4 
I have to admit when I went to see this movie , I did n't really have high expectations But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed br br Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends There 's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that 's pretty much it for that character Which i do n't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie br br So while on a subway Rainn Wilson \( who i actually liked before this movie \) convinces him to talk to a hot girl , Uma Thurman This is strange to say the least , as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong under the category of hot br br Rainn Wilson 's performance is also far from hot Normally I'm all for his acting , but even he could n't salvage this movie His character was jumpy , unrealistic and rather annoying You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy , or just desperate It was almost painful br br But anyway , someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway , and Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero , or G Girl as they like to call her in the movie It still baffles me as to what the G stands for , but we 'll leave that for the message boards to debate br br The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny , but I find myself asking who has sex like that \? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman 's passion let 's say It makes my head hurt , but not in the I'm thinking really hard to understand this way br br When Uma insults Anna Faris , calling her a whore I had no debate with that Apart from the fact that she ca n't choose movies properly , she ca n't act and relies souly on the fact that she 's blonde and typical br br Overall I would 've walked out of the theater if i had n't paid 8 75 to see it The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry , especially Uma Thurman Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot does n't mean you 're acting br br Also , the script and storyline could 've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors , and their dying careers Overall , if you value your money , and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie 
There is NOTHING cool , hip , or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are SERIAL KILLERS ! If they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again , then we do n't WANT them to be a family What part of that did you have trouble grasping \? Why applaud this filth \? br br THIS silly filth is what you do if you ca n't do art ! One 's head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting This is a camera without a brain What really makes an artwork cool is profundity , questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history \( or , in this case , a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable ! \) Instead , this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown , thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it 's so far OUT , man ! \) These same violent events actually HAPPEN , every day They are NOT just in the film They refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to YOU Do you WANT those things done to you \? A child could have thought this up , it required zero imagination , it is NOT surrealism This lazy crap has no content , is saying nothing it 's just the worst of the evening news , it is saying nothing new , nothing we do n't already know It 's the emperor 's new clothes , the director hoping there are enough uneducated children , proud of their streak of inhumanity , for this sloppy filth to fly I can see director Miike 's demented fans now chain smoking teens and twenties drunks covered in tattoos , with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces , their knowledge base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves br br There is NO PLOT to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence There is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic , BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE ! To DO that you need to view review a REAL piece of cinema There are PLENTY out there , directed by Fellini , Bergman , Fassbinder , Herzog , Altman , Bunuel , Kurosawa , Lynch , Tarkovsky , Peter Greenaway , Tarantino , Guillermo del Toro , Richard Linklater , Eisenstein , Aronofsky , Gus van Sant , Soderbergh , Shyamalan , Ordet Why do n't you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants \? This wannabe director , Miike , will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just does n't have the talent ! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like Visitor Q Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon ! There 's no message , no meaning , no plot , nothing to it at all There are long lists of ART Films to learn from but THIS Visitor Q is NOT an art film in any respect It has no content to it It 's just one banal horror piled onto another , and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN , every single day , somewhere in the world They are NOT okay because they are just in the film They refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to YOU Do you WANT those things done to you \? To others \? Why \? Because this world is already ugly enough , thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this br br There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct , but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap There IS no deeper meaning There is nothing to analyze why keep trying \? I 've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made , and keeping up with all the new ones , but I 've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this It 's not imaginative or even shocking , because these types of events happen daily all over the world To make this film , or even to favorably review it , has caused over 50 young airheads who do n't know any better to think it 's cool They may grow up thinking that , convincing others , some of whom may end up DOING these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way , by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity Trust me on this , I know cool , and cool this piece of crap AIN'T Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film , and I'm still not sure it is n't , actually br br Your actions have consequences , son The world is awful enough already Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU , or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film Believe me , you wo n't be thinking it 's Cool when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half !

After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review This is my first ever so bare with me br br First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest \( with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me \) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I was n't particularly thrilled either ! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing , after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in Until she adds her constantly away father to the house , due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches br br Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach br br In conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab ! 
You might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made for from the beginning , since the credits list Susan Dey as Special Guest Star Um , why would a one off MOW like this have a guest star \? Well , if you stick with it , you 'll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms Dey 's butt , wiggling in a flowered bikini as the Partridge Family house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes Susan 's derri re is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene Sadly , Susie and her tush fight a losing battle the jiggle TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off , so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role In 1976 Fat Freddy Silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as Susan 's audition tape for Charlie 's Angels As is , our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber , neurotic women br br The view beyond Susan 's heinie , it must be said , is not very compelling The scenery is nice , and photographed in a bizarre , hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera Nope It 's just a typically suspense challenged 70 's made for TV thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash \( and collect some cable residuals , though they obviously did n't know that at the time \) and show off their range Here we 're treated to a TV scale nuclear family , squaring off against TV scale thugs who ca n't decide whether they 're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult \( thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies \) and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television do n't mess with Dennis Weaver \( see McCloud and Duel \) The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage son character of Steve , played by the long forgotten \( if ever remembered \) Kristoffer Tabori , who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is \( supposedly \) menacing his family But Steve , as played by Tabori \( gosh , why did n't we see more from this wunderkind \? \) , is actually just grumpy and moody and is n't one bit conflicted when big D gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial \( and literal \) sand For the sleep deprived and Susan Deyniacs \( there must be some of you out there \) only 
I'm among millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans , but I ca n't think of a single reason to recommend this movie I do n't understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it appears no one else did , if we 're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards br br Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was superb at chasing and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby Here the director or writers try to rehash the idea , but it fails miserably I 've read comments about how creepy Drake was , but I thought that was far too mild a description Franchot Tone walked through this one as if he were hungover A casting disaster is one thing This film is a total disaster br br This one does n't deserve 10 lines of comments and I do n't know why that 's a requirement Too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults br br Unless you want to torture someone , give this one a wide berth 
London Dreams , directed by Vipul Shah , is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people It 's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat Ajay Devgan plays Arjun , an aspiring pop artiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at London 's Wembley Stadium He becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band mate Manu , played by Salman Khan , who is evidently more talented than him , but nowhere near as focused or ambitious Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latter 's popularity threatens to outshine his own Now here 's where a heart to heart might have helped Had Arjun explained what this Wembley fixation meant to him , Manu would have graciously backed off and let Arjun fulfill his childhood dream , and we 'd have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours London Dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back story involving Arjun 's grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage fright at a packed Wembley concert Or the ridiculous incident at a show where Manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes Arjun into silence The idiocy , however , does n't end there In his attempts to shame Manu publicly , Arjun uses his connections to get Manu hooked onto drugs A buxom groupie urges Manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine Before you know it , Manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder , practically chomping it down like dinner If that is n't silly enough , there 's a crude scene later in which Manu chases after the said girl to find out who she 's been taking orders from The pursuit ends in a dark London alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead Manu 's girlfriend who 's been secretly following after them Wait , there 's more ! Expect to howl hysterically when Arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the band 's lead dancer Priya \( played by Asin \) because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals Too generously inspired by Milos Forman 's Amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last year 's Rock On ! , Vipul Shah 's latest is a clunky melodrama that 's as loosely directed as it is scripted The film goes for broad humor , over the top emotions , and basically chooses loudness over subtlety That works for Manu 's character , with Salman Khan playing him all loutish and lovable , but in the case of Arjun , Ajay Devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised When Arjun does reach boiling point however , it results in an awkward pre climax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment Of the remaining cast , there 's not a kind word I can say for Asin , who practically lit up Ghajini with her ebullient charm , but disappoints here with unnecessary over acting in a thankless role Ranvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapur , reduced to mere sidekicks in the band , show up at regular intervals , usually to utter some inane dialogue like , We 'll rock it dude ! For its dim witted writing and sloppy direction , London Dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch If you must , watch it for Salman Khan who 's turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style It 's the only thing that 'll make you smile in this sad , sad film 
This movie is so bad it 's funny It stars Scott Backula as some coach , but that 's not important , what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base First off he has to be at least 75 years old , yet still plays minor league baseball , second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk , let alone run Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film , \( SPOILER \) , he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run , clearly downtown viewed this as a good move He hit the home run and won the game for his team , a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie Now if only Tony Muser , manager of the Royals , would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat , the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game 
I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it Well , I ca n't imagine anyone liking this movie because it 's just bad , bad , bad br br It 's obvious that whoever made this movie does n't know a single thing about horror The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie \( guns and criminals \) and horror \( living scarecrows \) When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows , the two genres automatically cancel each other out because , first , they 're criminals and who cares about criminals , and second , because they 're stupid criminals to boot ! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does n't work here Where 's the horror in that \? I wanted the criminals to die horrible , painful deaths br br But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres , which could have been original if handle well , NEVER gels We 're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows , which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible \( TV like \) and , worse offense of all , whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs , and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we 're watching some sort of Radio show This part was really BAD The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea ! I ca n't tell you how annoying that was br br As I 've already mentioned , the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid For instance , when someone suddenly shows up , gutted and filled with money and straw \( yep , straw \) in his huge open wound , the others ask What drug is he on \? after they shoot tons of bullets in him , unable to kill him \( he 's been zombiefied by the scarecrows Do n't ask \) Get a freaking clue , morons I 've never seen such stupid people in a movie And then there 's the girl I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross , she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene \( bad acting \) , even though the criminals could n't have done it What a dimwit she was ! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick They 're not scary Nothing much is explained about them They 're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie br br Mr Wesley , filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop does n't elicit anything but sheer boredom And that scene with the talking head in the fridge Thanks for the laughter br br All in all , this had to be one of the worst movies I 've seen recently \( and I 've seen a lot of movies these days ! \) Between the equally woeful SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS , I 'd rather watcher SILO KILLER again Yep , SCARECROWS is that bad 
Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid , redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' \( directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper \) and 'Lake Placid' Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and on top of that it likes to exaggerate tremendously The saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old , over 30 ft long \( ! \) and it kills for fun ! During the film , he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location Even though it 's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this , the lagoons and nature looks marvelous Every other aspect is simply disastrous There 's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable The dialogues are downright painful to listen to ! You wo n't believe some of the lines these actors have to say ! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they 're not that stupid ! Early in the film , one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg 's great white shark The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress I wo n't say too much about the acting since it 's secondary in flicks like this The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast You guessed right Blood Surf is a very bad film So bad it becomes fun again But 'funny' for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended 
There are pretty landscape shots Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths With lesser actors this show would be silly 'Art must uplift humanity or it 's BS ' Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side The lead character even says those who do n't drink hide the shadow side Wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes There was n't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes The discussions between the characters was grade school , trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie I was moved only once towards the end The kid was way too passive The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous Just my opinion but nowhere show for me 
This is n't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology , or being dated , issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with , but rather a review on the story telling , which most of us are truly interested in br br The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members , and two civilians \( the hero and heroine \) , who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs br br The manipulations are n't so bad by film standards , and we know from the plot that realism is n't going to be high What films like this need are credible and likable characters , along with some semblance of reason in the actions br br This film lacks both For a full length film , only 6 characters are given any time , and 3 of them are barely looked into McClure 's hero is beyond routine , and does n't make much sense in any era br br The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered , but the riddle is not much of a riddle , and we could care less br br A lot of failure in a film that should have been better , even for its time 
The Incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man , but with violence and some nudity I know this film is a bit crummy but I found it impossible not to kind of like it br br The acting and script are not the best But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of 50 the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it 's reasonably impressive we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution Of note too is the music , it 's insane a cheese tastic medley of nonsense br br Notable highlights br br Marvel at the slow motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever br br Be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head br br Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid Called Steve br br Be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen br br This film is just too 70 's for me to hate it It 's tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun You could do a lot worse 
There was a genie played by Shaq His name was Kazaam , and he was whack His rhymes were corny , this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin , bad casting , bad special effects whats next \? this movie sucks Prolly did n't make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp br br Yeah , you get it , a stupid rhyming genie who ca n't act , in a stupid movie with horrible special effects Oh , and its confusing as hell I'm not even gonna go on Let 's just say , it belongs in the its so bad , its funny category Watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh But do n't expect anything spectacular 
On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son , and that he wants to go home to his real mother br br In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie making , perhaps the 60 's or 70 's Certainly it reminded me of Losey 's Secret Ceremony \( 1968 \) , and Richard Loncraine 's Full Circle \( 1977 \) , both of which deal with loss , grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children \( curiously both films star Mia Farrow \) br br All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways All three films have a chilly feel , both emotionally and literally All three films focus on mother child relationships , and ultimately all three films pose the question 'what is real , what is imagined \? ' br br Beautiful but flawed , it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging , unexplained and strange 
I do n't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out I do n't know what it was that made me hate it so , but if it means trying to watch it again I'm not willing to find out 
This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen ! ! ! ! br br I can honestly say I have never seen a movie worse than this one ! ! ! br br AND I MEAN NEVER ! ! ! ! br br I'm a BIG fan of B horror movies As you may imagine I 've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer br br I was lured to this movie by it 's title I mean c'mon what true fan of horror would n't be intrigued by a title like Vampires vs Zombies \? \? \? Images of the undead battling each other to the undeath danced in my head I thought to myself this I 've got to see ! ! ! ! br br Well sorry to say this I wish I had n't seen ! ! ! ! ! br br This movies title is very misleading to say the least There was no vampires fighting zombies In fact , there is no plot ! ! ! ! If you were to ask me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea ! ! ! br br There was no plot ! ! ! ! br br There was no story ! ! ! ! br br This movie absolutely makes no sense at all ! ! ! ! br br At the end of this debacle I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense ! ! ! 
Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely no knowledge off br br I missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea Viggo Mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap TVM , certainly the opening with the mawkish Pearl and Marty taking their kids to a Summer camp has that sort of made for TV feel though the brightly lit \( Too brightly lit \) cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of Viggo Mortensen as hippy guy Walker that I realised this was a cinema release , after all someone of Mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a TVM , I mean that`s like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in a straight to video film Wait a minute , didn`t Bob \? br br Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing on screen couple and I agree I can understand why Pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why Walker would be attracted to plain house wife Pearl The sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days so I guess that explains it br br I feel the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart \( Just like you`d expect in a TVM \) with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene \? It jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock In other words A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
As myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we could n't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled ! However for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a disgrace ! The worst film I have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it ! br br The acting is awful the effects well I could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck , hands etc No story line , weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script ! br br you broke my tooth ! from one vampire you broke my cigar was the response from the human who looked like uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa ! 
The title says it all Tail Gunner Joe was a tag given to the Senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day , he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane He could n't have done that if the gun had been properly aligned The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted , in public , before a camera , that he was responsible he had made the error , not the Senator The fact that the film did not report that fact , shows how one sided it is This film was designed to do one thing , destroy the reputation of a complex person br br A much better program was the PBS special done on him He was a hard working , intelligent , ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights He made some mistakes , some serious mistakes , but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them br br The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories , one sided stories , so that they do n't have to think 
The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller \( looking surprisingly aged a year after Tarzan and the Huntress \) is bad , in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller , shooting in beautiful scenery in M xico , with a top star of that country \( Andrea Palma \) and multiple award winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa , and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score Although it may have cost less for filming abroad , it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series , taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania , and with impressive d cors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu \( especially the exterior , built on steep rocks \) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director , instead of Robert Florey , who gives it a very slow pace Neumann had done a fine work with Tarzan and the Amazons , Tarzan and the Leopard Woman and Tarzan and the Huntress , and finished his career directing the classic The Fly the year before his death while Florey became a television director , after a career of few remarkable films If Weissmuller looks tired , the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others , but the worst character is Benji , an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs \( that have a Caribbean air , in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in M xico ! \) Boring and decidedly of dubious taste , it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller 's Tarzan 
I have never seen a worse movie br br It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie br br Mistake 1 absolutely no connection to any of the characters In this movie you do n't bond with any of the characters because you do n't get a chance br br The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand Salish as played by Clint Howard Except for this unique character , the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining br br Mistake 2 the worst gunfight scene ever I love gunfights I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is Apathetic I 've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME In this movie it looked and felt like the Actors were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion br br Why \? Where 's the trash talking \? where 's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire \? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity br br If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters , I recomend Sam Rami 's Evil Dead series DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie 
I never was an avid viewer of Crocodile Hunter , but did occasionally see an episode , or a bit of an episode , and when the news spread about Steve Irwin 's death from a stingray attack in 2006 , it certainly caught my attention This movie , with Steve and his wife , Terri , playing themselves , but in a fictional story , was released in 2002 , but I did n't hear of it until several years later , and even after that , it took me a while to get around to seeing it Well , now I have seen it , and after looking here first \( more than once \) , and seeing its rating , I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be , though it could have been a BIT better Apparently , it 's supposed to be a comedy , so a major problem with it is that it is n't very funny at all br br A U S satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia , where it is swallowed by a crocodile ! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt , and are unaware of what 's inside it , two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon ! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley , and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them ! On Steve and Terri 's mission , they face other types of dangerous wildlife , not just the crocodile , and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it , when Steve sees the CIA agents after them , he mistakes them for poachers ! br br Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film , the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents Apart from that , I do n't think I found anything even mildly amusing It 's also a bit of an incoherent mess , switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters , and it seems like clips from Crocodile Hunter and clips from an action thriller \( or something like that \) put together for some reason Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes , which also seem to be from somewhere else , and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt , played by Magda Szubanski , is supposed to be , she 's not At one point , we see her farting , so we have a fart joke , a MAJOR clich in modern comedy ! Are they SO hard to resist \? ! I also found the typical Crocodile Hunter scenes , with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers , to be tedious , but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show did n't help br br Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist , and is sadly missed by them , while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him No matter which side you 're on , The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course is not a well crafted movie I'm sure it does help if you 're a big Steve Irwin fan , but even if you are , there 's no guarantee that you would like this movie , as some fans clearly have n't been impressed In fact , it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have , so maybe it WON'T help Like I said , there 's no guarantee I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show , this movie was unnecessary The attempt to combine what is usually seen in Crocodile Hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed , and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes ! 
SLASHERS \( 2 outta 5 stars \) br br Not really a very good movie but I did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with The movie is ostensibly an episode of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them The survivor , if there is one , wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad None of the real people seem real at all The actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and that 's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show The movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly \( to hide the cuts from one take to another , I would imagine \) 
Not that I tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed , but when I put a DVD in expecting a bloodbath , and what I get is one bloody scene \( the eyeball \) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping , and spinning in a desk chair , I end up thinking well that 's 43 minutes of my life gone forever I would n't considers this or Flower of Flesh and Blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them Flower of Flesh and Blood had a few tough spots to watch The Devil 's Experiment did not It was at best , stupid , and at worst well really stupid Perhaps my expectation were too high I put the DVD thinking oh man , this is gonna be sick After watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times , I was watching it in fast forward br br Two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 \) People who seek out F 'd up films just to see how F 'd up it really is , or 2 \) horror completest I sought this and the other Guinea Pig films for the latter reason , but even if I fell into the category of the former , this film would n't float my boat As a matter of fact , I could imagine this film increasing one 's blood lust as in WOULD YOU JUST KILL THE B TCH ALREADY ! ! So in conclusion , the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes If you want carnage that traditional horror does n't provide , get Traces of Death Sure , that sucks too , but at least you 'll get the blood and guts you expect br br The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they 're supposed to No artistic merit that I can comprehend , no reason for it 's notoriety , no nothing Just a lame attempt to be shocking 
The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire The script is weak and has been presented badly The film just has no life in it Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing There 's nothing wrong with their singing , its just everything else in this turkey thats overcooked 
In an otherwise good review , loleralacartelort7890 says The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy It is not that well known And the exact specifications are a secret And why is it a secret Well , why should they reveal it back then \? \? If they where in a space race with the Russians , then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation This is completely incorrect There is \( and was \) no secret to radiation protection in Apollo The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available It uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel The entire outer surface \( except the windows of course \) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin , thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry These materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space \( charged particles \) than lead , which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X rays and gamma rays br br Space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares But it simply was n't a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief \( 1 2 hour or so \) passage through the Van Allen belts They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1 5 rem , and usually much less Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon \( 12 of whom landed \) , 18 are still alive Only two have died from cancer Alan Shepard \( leukemia \) and Jack Swigert \( bone cancer \) The rest died from heart attacks , pancreatitis \( Roosa \) , and a motorcycle accident \( Conrad \) These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s \( Shepard would be 86 \)

 \( Some possible spoilers \) br br I'm not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences \( mostly families \) to see it in droves Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend , it made 26 mil , roughly and has made 38 1 mil total \( an estimation for this weekend \) But I think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did , when I saw and they spread the word This is one majorly lame movie , apart from the animation everything else , mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old br br The movie is only about 80 mins long , but it feels like a three hour epic A few sticking points for me are , well the irritating narration is one of them , and it 's so obviously written At one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared , up pops the narrator \( the voice of the talented Matt Damon \) to clear up any misconceptions \( which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets br br Another one is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs , now I'm a fan of his music , I think he 's good , but come on did Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8 9 of his songs throughout such a short movie , I certainly could n't Finally and here 's a spoiler , a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary , no less , she \( the horse \) then falls into a raging river , Spirit \( the focus of the movie \) tries to save her , but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop , well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well Now I know this is a kids movie , but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable br br To sum up , this is a really lame movie , I'm not saying kids wo n't enjoy it , but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end Definitely on my Top 10 worst list of this year out of 4 stars br br 
Its hard to make heads or tails of this film Unless you 're well oiled and in the mood to mock , do n't view Santa Claus It mixes Santa , Satan , Merlin , and moralizing in a most unappetizing way It certainly is not for fretful children 
The name Uwe Boll is automatically linked to bad horror cult cinema and every new movie he releases which is about two , three per year immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism You 're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype You know , like it 's popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not Let me just assure you that this is NOT the case Uwe Boll is a terrible writer director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film making industry Seed is another most unfortunate of proof that In here , Boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist , like a plot , a narrative structure , character development , tension building Seed is a hideous movie , full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage I once read that Seed was Uwe Boll 's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks , but that 's not even close The film inarguably does borrow some influences from Saw and Hostel , but basically it 's just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence br br The first 45 minutes of Seed are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen For you see , Boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a \( hyper fast \) scrolling text explaining there 's a federal US law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail So you know this will happen later on , but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair Seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims \( exaggerate much \? \) who wears a bag over his head He watches real life animal cruelty footage \( and thus WE watch real life animal cruelty footage thanks for that Mr Boll \) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar \( including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted \) When he 's finally captured , during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed , and put on death row , the film even becomes more retarded After being buried alive because the electric chair could n't fry him , Max Seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him br br The senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad they 're downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic Multiple twists and sub plot in Seed are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they 're just too dumb ! Nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him ! Seed is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes Personally , I refuse to accept that the cast crew members did n't notice this as well It really makes you think that Uwe Boll simply neglects all advice and criticism , and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to I imagine his yelling stuff like shut up and do as you are told to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they 're shooting does n't make a lick of sense br br Just for the fun of upsetting people , there 's a gigantically overlong sequence where Max Seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she 's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room Instead of shocking , as Boll intended it to be , this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is Seed is horrendous , it 's disgusting , it 's pitiable , it 's Boll 
I 'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we 'd both heard that this was a terrifying film , really scary How disappointed was I \? \?

LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected ! He did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department From the very beginning , he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he 's in He acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody , yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job He was quite clearly the best character in the movie br br This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner There are so many ways his character \( Moses Ashford \) could have taken a more pivotal role That he did n't was disappointing and a true let down I was hoping to see more from him in this film br br Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive This movie is a typical action movie that \( at least initially \) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past Being an action movie , it has its share of shoot em up scenes , blood , and guts These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot out br br What irked me most was the way Timberlake 's character behaved during shoot out scenes He starts out having guns and not using them Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he 's been firing a gun his whole life Then he runs out of bullets and does n't have a gun and 30 seconds later , without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo \? ! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me br br If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay , then you 'll probably love this movie Personally , it does n't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic Make me believe that the story is true This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied 
Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan 's Black Wedding Criminally Insane , and it 's a good thing too , because when I 've seen a movie and know there 's a sequel \( especially something that 's as obscure as this \) I'm always curious I 've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again Most of CI2 is nothing but flashbacks to CI , and footage of Ethel asleep , recalling fond memories , I guess Thanks to Proposition 13 she 's released from Napa State \( wonder if she got to see The Cramps play while she was there \? \) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to calling granny This is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic , and it 's even complete with a couple of rolls Of course Ethel does her thing , which is to dispatch anyone between her and food , especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert Also , you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink Guess that 's all a matter of misguided trust If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane , either way there 's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity One wonders why the makers of this even bothered 2 out of 10 
An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children 's book Crude and inappropriate humor , some scary parts , and a sickening side story about the mom 's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book \( 3 8 \) yr olds Do n't waste your money , your time , or your good judgement 
Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for but to be effective they must also be entertaining Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell 's 1984 \( first published in 1948 \) , and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film br br Watch or read it and then , when you are feeling a little depressed by man 's inhumanity to man , reach for Cinderella 2000 This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption There are many worse films appearing as DVD 's these days , and frankly I do not care much what happens either way br br So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been The Handmaiden 's Tale , but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London 's towering novel The Iron Heel Ambitious as this would be , it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it \( IMDb only lists a B W silent version made in Russia in 1919 \) 
Well well well As good as John Carpenter 's season 1 outing in Masters of Horror was , this is the complete opposite He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with Cigarette Burns but Pro Life is perhaps the worst I have seen from him br br It 's stupid , totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it 's welcome , despite the less than an hour running time The script is nonsense , the characters are irritable and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd br br And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD \( one of them being me \) did you see how Carpenter describes the film \? He 's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time , and he praises the script And in the commentary track , where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut , he just says he did n't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there I fear the old master has completely lost his touch I sincerely hope I'm proved wrong br br I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome , though Technically speaking , this film is top notch , with effective lighting schemes and make up effects

This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic , Romance on the High Seas br br The story line is more or less same but is contemporary Govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip While Rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour They ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in Bombay br br On the trip , Govinda mistakes another girl for Sanjiv 's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing Rani br br Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings They are pitted against each other for the warring couple br br It is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling The comedy is slap stick and will not make one laugh too much 
This movie has some of the worst acting that I have ever seen ! Some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor This nail trap catches these bad guys The rest of the movie degrades as you go I ca n't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time I also ca n't believe that there are sequels !

I have an awful pan and scan videotape of Boom ! , and I want to see it in all its widescreen glory So I voted 1 and hope you will too Together , we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross , and hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY in releasing Boom ! in its Director 's Cut Extended Version The movie is one of my howling favorites you just look at the people involved , the director , the actors , the cameraman , and you say to yourself , Yep , I guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time Producers considering the DVD release of Boom ! should note that , everywhere it 's been shown , there have been sellout crowds in the theaters But it has n't been up to Frostbite Falls yet 
OK OK , it might be hard to put the entirety of a man 's life in one film Traditionally therefore , biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject 's life Now , Byron was a my week beats your year fellow , which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder Furthermore , just as Byron 's poetry is inseparable from his life , the man 's life itself must be seen as a whole Lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture , it 's showing a different picture altogether br br Now , in short my review comes down to this supposedly , Byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype , a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime True , he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in but in the end , this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we 'd all want to lead , no \? Well , I did NOT , at ANY moment , want to live the life depicted in this film So it gets 3 Not for being so badly done \( which , direction wise , it more or less was \) , but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot br br Some more detail Well , to over simplify things , a Byron bio should have two distinct episodes 1 Post first Europe trip England and his rise to fame marriage 2 His life abroad Now , the important thing is that the SECOND part should be at least as important as the first Not only was it a lot longer , but the most significant change in Byron took place then Furthermore , it 's where he created his best works \( Don Juan , the Vision of Judgement etc all the stuff that makes him really unique in English literature \) br br Instead , in this film \( a \) Byron 's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining , \( b \) it only gets worse after he leaves England They did two good jobs first , they started at his return of his Europe trip \( though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue \) , second , they chose an angle , and they chose his incestuous love for Augusta \( who is rather perfectly cast \) The problem with this last thing is that they never let it go True , Byron remained strongly attached to Augusta for the rest of his life , but , especially as he was such a mood swing person , the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life br br Anyway , the first part of the TV film should have ended with him leaving England There 's no doubt about that The thing is once abroad , a life of debauchery began \( with the infamous Geneva period \) , but in Italy Byron also discovered a new life , both for his poetry \( inspired by Italian comedy \) , already in Venice , and for himself when he found the Contessa Teresa Guiccioli and moved to Ravenna \( afterwards , at the request of Shelly , with Teresa , to Pisa \) In other words , he was also liberated His mind and life opened up \( and not only in the decadent sense \) , while England 's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the Victorian age True , freedom was Augusta less , but this bitter sweet freedom tastes sour in this film We see a lonely , bored snob getting older br br I mean , hell , Byron never thought much about his poetry , except when he finally found his own voice in Don Juan ! Apart from poetic and romantic developments , his relationship with Shelly \( and the down break \) should have been more documented Also , it is in Italy in Ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas This is important , as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of Childe Harold is changing into the more planted in life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of Don Juan Life and work are one True , still a bit naive , but it 's what got him to Greece ! And the whole thing came full circle in Pisa , where Shelley 's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark Missolonghi was n't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action It was the insights in Italy \( the Gambas \) stirring him into action It can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient style battle excitement while the rest of Europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism But it was n't just that , there was a true inspiration behind it Meanwhile , Byron wrote massive amounts of Don Juan True , his end is a bit sad , but it 's not like he 's worn out THAT is the essence of Byron 's life he may have had some strong emotional attachments \( 2 Augusta and Teresa \) , but EVERY time he managed to reinvent himself truly Meaning that he was n't 'less' at the end of his life no , he 'd made a physical and mental JOURNEY that , at the time , few people were prepared to make br br I wonder Why is it that so often the second period in Byron 's life is overlooked \? Because it had less obvious conflicts , as the man was finally coming to his own \? In focusing our attention on the frustrated England years fraught with scandals , we show ourselves to be not much better than the English aristocracy at the time , which Byron so despised , and which , despite the fact that he had no choice , he willingly fled in 1816 , to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause 
Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea That is the problem is n't \? The concept is fresh and full of potential , but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters This movie does n't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why First you do n't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation They are not believable in the way they act and interact Example Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum , frowning and looking intense all the time is n't the way to go here I mean what is that \? , he looks like he 's on the toilet or something I loved him in re animator and the way he was playing the intense neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money But not for this , he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner , it 's not natural , I'm surprised he did n't dislocate his jaw during filming The movie is basically on life support , it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come 
This weekend just passed I watched 28 Weeks Later which was very good After that I watched this film br br I have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch The scenes were unrealistic , there was no script and no plot The alien creature was unreal And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight And to make it worse the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film br br Forget about this movie rather go and watch 28 Weeks Later br br Cheers , Mesake C 
I actually had hopes for this movie since I 've seen Kari in a few other things and think she has some talent Alas , this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay Completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability , and no plot whatsoever Is it a road buddy comedy thriller romance drama \?

Man , I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess Having seen the first two episodes thus far , I think I can safely say this show is n't going to be on my must see list It 's just got so many things working against it br br None of the actors cast are particularly good Anna Paquin as the lead character Sookie , is just awful I remember her being better in a lot of other things I 've seen her in so maybe it 's just the writing She 's not really much fun to look at either , there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly The actor who plays Bill is marginally better , if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof The other actors do their best but with the clich characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it 's a tough job Tara is an absolute misery to watch , Rutina Wesley absolutely murders the accent It 's like nails on a chalkboard bad Almost as awful is Nelsan Ellis , it 's difficult to understand what he 's even saying sometimes Both his character as well as Tara 's also seem a bit racist to me I do n't know , having a character say 'whycome' on an HBO show that is n't The Wire just seems a bit odd Rounding out the cast so far are Sookie 's doddering grandmother , her sex addict brother , and the only bit of genius casting I 've seen in William Sanderson as the sheriff br br The story seems to be meandering towards it 's destination at this point , with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested The romance stuff is very Dark Shadow sy Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten At times it seemed so campy to me , that I just have to assume it was intended to be But unlike a show such as Buffy , that pulled camp off masterfully , this show does not Out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show I'm not averse to either of these when they are done well , as they have in many other HBO shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless br br About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately , I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air 
It is a Frank Zappa axiom that music journalism is people who ca n't write interviewing people who ca n't talk for people who ca n't read If you ever needed proof that musicians ca n't talk , this is the film for you Repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices Wow \( Thank you , Idris Muhammed \) This film is pretentious but , while much of the pontificating from Youssou N'Dour and his gang of merry men \( and one token woman \) grates , the music saves the day br br The main idea behind the film \( what I take to be the main idea , dredged out of the inarticulate commentary \) is interesting To gather a group of musicians from America and Europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery , back to their roots in the music of West Africa , and a concert in the old slave fort of Gor e off the coast of Senegal We are treated to gospel , blues , jazz and variations of these , including some fantastic drumming both in New Orleans and Senegal There 's also a good deal of N'Dour 's own compositions br br Sadly , that 's another weakness It 's never entirely clear what N'Dour himself wants to achieve To some degree , the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on N'Dour 's part He wants to play his own music , jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires He 's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the Curator of the Gor e museum br br The clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places For example , somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir , but N'Dour and most of his mates are Moslems \( a point made repeatedly throughout the film \) The whole early sequence involving the black Christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group \( the only black Christians who can hold a tone \? \) turn up in Dakar at the end of the film \( To be fair , they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film \) If the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel , why not also in the direction of Latin America \? Where are the black musical influences from the Caribbean and Brazil \? Samba \? Reggae \? Then there 's Europe Here the black diaspora does n't seem to have produced any musicians of calibre , since N'Dour chooses to draft in Austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from Luxemburg Are they in the team just because N'Dour has played with him before \? What I personally found most irritating , though , was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik black power Nation of Islam cultural happening in the New York home of Amir Baraka \( a k a Leroi Jones \) Hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history , and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance Why do so many African Americans believe that taking an Arabic name is an assertion of their African roots \? And why do they think Arabic Islam is so much more admirable than European Christianity \? Who do they think established the trade in African slaves in the first place \? The film does n't have much to say about the situation in West Africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years The Senegalese appear to be a poor but happy , musical gifted folk , friendly and welcoming , respectful of their elders \( and not above fleecing the visiting Americans in the fish market \) Is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination \? There is no comment on the armed guard that N'Dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of Dakar br br There is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from Dakar came from Dakar The similarity between the folk drumming style of New Orleans and the folk drumming style of Senegal is cited in evidence The last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland , bidding them farewell Except , of course , that by and large , the slaves shipped from Dakar did not come from Dakar They were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal Senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever European power currently held the Gor e slave fort The people of Dakar are not the descendents of Africans who escaped the slave trade , they are just as likely more likely to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile br br The two agenda 's clash again in the final part of the film There are two separate endings On the one hand , the concert which N'Dour and Co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the Gor e slave fort The other end comes when the Harmony Harmoneers sing the spiritual Return to Glory , in the seaward doorway of the slave fort This is deeply moving , even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears br br This is a film that is flawed Unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions Irritating , confusing , beautiful and emotional by turns Watch it \( listen to it \) for the music and the feeling , but do n't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour 
I might not be a huge admirer of the original Creepshow , but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection ! And to think I was going into this expecting to like this one more Five years after its predecessor , George Romero gets back on board the EC Comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for Steve King 's three stories Though , the direction is handed off to Michael Gornick The film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick But most of the blame would have to go to Romero 's dreadfully static and unbearably cringe like script \( especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story \) Moralistic messages \( that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters \) simply took over the black humour Oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture Loosely linking the three tales \( Old Chief Woodenhead , The Raft and The Hitchhiker \) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia \( 80s \) animation form I rather liked this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light br br The first story Old Chief Woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors \( George Kennedy Dorothy Lamour \) of a general store in a dying native community , Dead River Get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in Hollywood In front of the store is a wooden statue of an Indian Chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths br br Listen to George Kennedy waffle And waffle on for 10 minutes about how he 's committed to his 'great' community What a nice touchy feely time Well , just like Kennedy 's speeches , this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise The overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so These two factors really added to my headache When the Indian comes alive and turns avenger , the goons meet a very quick \( though grisly \) death in the proper fashion The effects were commendably done , but what about that free flowing hair How could Hollywood knock that lock of hair back \? Ugh ! br br Second story The Raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake , they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water br br Now this is much better , MUCH better What starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set up that 's full of tight and claustrophobic tension And it does n't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter Quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too The surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it The performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark Gornick 's direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side While , the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords The sludge like creature in the lake \( like many have mentioned \) looks like an icky black tarpaulin \( yeah you 're reading that right ! \) floating on the water br br Finally number three concludes with The Hitchhiker A wealthy , but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo , but she 's is running late Thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed , she skids off the road and accidentally hit 's a hitchhiker Instead of checking or getting help , she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband Soon enough she 's being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker br br Not awful , but I really did n't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all Compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead Lois Chiles was okay in the lead role , but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired The vivid make up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision When she hit 's the hitchhiker that 's when it becomes hectic , cheesy and over the top in its execution From there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line , Thanks for the ride lady ! This happens every time she decides to run over him Have a little courtesy for the dead darling br br In all , the second short story The Raft and the unpleasantly , well conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel

I must agree with the very first comment this movie sucks very , very hard Despite having a very big B list cast , the cover of this film \( for those who are n't watching it on Comedy Central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get \) tries to put the blame on Dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has been comedian from the '80s Randy Quaid \?

This film is probably the worst film that I have ever seen I'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog , so the language barrier was n't an issue I must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie There is only one professional actor in the cast and I'm guessing no professional directors or writers br br Although I have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably does n't merit such a poor rating This is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7 3 to something more realistic Perhaps 4 3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back br br The real shame is that I am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length However if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around IMDb you might as well go ahead give Lost in Translation a 10 as well

Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time , but this time as a different character No one on board seems to notice maybe it was the hair Regardless , this time she is not the receptacle for a god \( see the previous episode \) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy \( the standard human response \) Unfortunately , the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador \( who , oddly , lives in a small crate this is a lousy way to travel \) And , unfortunately , Muldayr is n't wound all that well herself What happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it , I was pretty relieved Watching all the men on board go ga ga over Muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy Do yourself a favor if you have n't seen the show before , pick a different episode

An illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many Well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced , yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed The little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate , but I cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie

Back at the house , the sorority bimbos swim , shower , change clothes and have sex with men from the bar A small silver ball \( part of the experiment \) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling , killer zombies ! br br If that is n't enough to entertain you , there 's a hilarious theme song \( Nightmare Fantasy \) , roller skating , some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet \( ! \? \) that warns DANGER ! DANGER ! just like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men ! br br This filmed in Florida mess is so mind numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in And , hey is n't that NYPD Blue 's Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN newscaster Andrea Thompson as one of oft nude bimbos \? Sure is ! Supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985 br br Score 1 out of 10 \( and I mean that in a good way ! \) 
The good thing about this that 's at least fresh Almost no movies about dance music and the club scene \( if even made \) hit the cinemas And it radiates lots of energy too , from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza br br But the main problem is that it ca n't decide what it wants to be Although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap , the makers also realized they would n't want to play copycat However , it fails grossly on the jokes because it 's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped And it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes , so why not edit it down to 75 \? The production department and cinematography still try to save the day \( e g Paul 's home \) br br In a strange way and unexpectedly so It 's all gone Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting power br br Conclusion it 's a mess , it somewhat entertains at a basic level , but you better spend a night in your favorite club 
Prot g runs in a linear fashion expect no fast paced action , and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating on the edge moments br br There is not much of a crux , so do n't expect one either I would not fault the acting the show would have been much worst if not for Wu 's acting which was the film 's only saving grace And , oh that cute little girl too br br The humour is at best , weak , and the show must as well pass off as an anti drug campaign which employs the usual shock tactic \( esp in the scenes with Zhang \) to tell us stuff that we already know i e drugs break up families , heroin drives you crazy , it is not so easy to wean off , you will fall into a vicious cycle br br I know it may seem all a little harsh , but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy \( SPOILER ALERT Take for example when Andy Lau got brought to the police station what \? we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997' , and THAT is how he got caught Nope , no chasing car action , just a jump of scene , which kind of undermined Wu 's role as an undercover in the first place \) I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all , a production of Mediacorp Raintree a Singaporean production film company 
What an appalling piece of rubbish ! ! ! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is \? Yes , it 's arty and yes , it 's foreign , but that 's not enough The plot is boring and disjointed , like a reality show but not so slickly made br br The people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do n't have enough depth to feel empathy for them If they are based on real people then I feel very , very sorry for them br br The violence \( and some of it is very violent \) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous It 's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino Not that I think very much of him , either br br And oh yes if I had neighbours like these , I 'd move ! 
Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles This film is fantastic Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter Plan 9 From OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against this Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece he 's from England and thoroughly sarcastic br br It has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her Though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira The whole thing is badly done br br Watch it for the script though
A perfect little atrocity I doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary MTV 4 4 seconds Woeful casting , worse even than in Kusminsky 's version \( a reminder he managed to miscast Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes \) But , hey the rich got what they deserved Dark and brooding Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden locked angel , frail and angellic Catherine presented as a chubby , melon breasted heffer , meek and weak Linton is a peeping tom , and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle Gellar 's character from Cruel Intentions 15 year old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners take notice This thing was made for you It is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters , but even from initial shock at their actions The actors tried , but , as I stated before , they were miscasted Decent photography , but editing is on the level of TV production class in high school I implore you all read the book , or the cliffnotes even watch the previous versions of it , even Kusminsky 's but stay away from the numerous future reruns , during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial free premiere 
I saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as Greendale in the movie , which is the only reason I went to see it Another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away His editorial comment in his forward is a good summary br br Yuk br br Unless you 're a Neil Young fan or live in near Greendale \( if the latter you know the real name \) , skip this movie It 's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker It has no discernible plot , the music is merely OK , and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be br br I do n't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away br br I 'd give this a 1 5 10 , but that 's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie It was n't worth the 6 I could rent a video camera and drive around Greendale and make a better movie myself br br If you want to see a good environmental message movie with no plot , go rent Koyaanisqatsi 
The movie had a lot of potential , unfortunately , it came apart because of a weak implausible story line , miscasting , and general lack of content substance One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery , who played an Arab man , did n't know how to pronounce his own Arab name ! This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details The quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br Movie 's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song \( I do n't recall the title \) Overall , it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast 
A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen \( God Told Me Too , Q , etc \) , Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably , even with decent turns by Ed McMahon \( ! \) and Kenneth Mars Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam simply looks numb This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic 
We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was on It was this movie Howling II The acting was terrible but the eye candy was great Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the afore mentioned eye candy I was laughing a lot from the few scenes I saw br br My friends wonder why I never want to go to Horror movies , If they saw this film they would know why I would get thrown out for laughing so hard br br Just a couple of trivia notes Reb Brown who played Ben White had played Captain American in a made for TV movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiration for the song Brown Sugar Mick has great taste in women for sure 
This so called documentary tries to tell that USA faked the moon landing Year right br br All those who have actually studied the case knows different br br First of all there is definitely proof When the astronauts was on the moon , they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon for geological studies These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs , who tested them And they all concluded that they came from the same planet , not earth because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth , but similar to those calculated to be on the moon I E the conspiracy theorists never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest br br Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing , I E the flag moves There is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand , so it moved And what proves this well , if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage , they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be , I E the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists , they cant study a subject properly , or only studies it until they have what they came for , so that they can make a lie from that , and make a profit \( I E this so called documentary \) br br A claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places , because there are different light sources , the artificial lighting from the studio Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong \( as usual \) , the same would happen in an earth desert at night , with no light sources But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck convention is held over br br The Conspiracy theorists are in denial , BIG TIME They only see what they want to see So they make up all these lies to seem important that is a fact

The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters Thankfully , highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time \( rated lower than Side Out and higher than , well , umm \) However , do n't let the cover of this movie decieve you Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes Using such high tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy , Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime While there are other actors in the movie , including brief cameos by Denise Richards , a gay negro , and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl , Koji carries this movie on his own Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot 
This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what NOT to do The original kicked some major tire squealing butt , this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of Bruckheimer films , which is we all know they suck , but they have great action This film has NO ACTION This film is BORING Where are the cars \? Where are the chases \? Where 's the tension \? Where 's the suspense \? Where 's the rush \? Where ! ! \? \? This is n't really a movie at all , it 's a bad commercial 50 cars in 24 hours \? That is wrong They have 3 days to steal them , the ad is wrong How bad is that \? The leads acting is stiff , wooden and forced The villain , the cop , the others who cares They utter their pointless lines , they serve the illogical plot They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says do n't worry we 'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is or we 'll fix it with lots of loud music The script is n't really a script at all , it 's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of Warning possible spoiler 5 4 3 2 1 The Fugitive The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones , man this is the baddest , coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction And what do they do ! \? They make him a mute who 's hardly in the film ! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film How could they have been so dumb \? How \? How \? Why \? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers ! Go find the original Or if you 're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money , all those resources , all that experience , and they ca n't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for 250 , 000 \? How can that be \? You feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie Where I was once excited to see Coyote Ugly , Remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor , now I say God help us all br br 
Well , what was fun except for the fun part br br It 's my second least favorite so far , I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine' br br Let 's start with the good The teaser , it was incredibly well done and also emotional Being the great animal lover that I am , it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode br br But then there 's all the bad , and believe me there is a lot of it Little made sense , so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated \? whaaa \? \? \? the dialog was also pretty awful There were about one or two quotable lines br br and worst of all , having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me In the end what 's the point \? they all pretty much died We did n't learn anything , we were n't entertained , and I could n't even find Sophia 's death sad just very frustrating br br star shame because Season 2 was doing so well 
Jill Dunne \( played by Mitzi Kapture \) , is an attractive , nice woman , over whelmed by a smart mouthed teenage daughter , Liv \( Martha MacIsaac \) and a petty , two timing husband , Sean \( Rick Roberts \) , both of which were tediously self centered , and obnoxious br br This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm br br The storm does n't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film , and then it is n't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar br br The stalking , likewise does n't get intense until almost the end of the film br br Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter , Liv , argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week br br Jill 's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack , a boy of questionable character , and they are constantly making out in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv 's bed br br The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill 's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her br br Sean was not at all appealing since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots br br The story begins with Jill being notified of an out standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to , and that she thought Sean had never been to either br br Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner manager , Richard Grant \( Nick Mancuso \) , a very nice , older , divorced man , who is sympathetic to her In fact , when he spots her husband there again , he phones Jill and tips her off br br Jill returns to the hotel , sees Sean with another woman She is upset , leaves without Sean seeing her , and does absolutely nothing In fact , she does n't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home This made no sense to me br br Jill has given Richard her business card , and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate She shows him a condo Afterwards they have a drink , and things get cozy between them br br Richard and Jill are getting it on , hot and heavy In fact , he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary , when Jill suddenly decides to cut out br br Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean and of course that 's all her fault too , as far as Sean is concerned br br The little family decides to go on a camping trip which means more whining and grousing among them , especially from the spoiled daughter br br I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody , but Jill br br 3 stars
I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I 've ever seen I did not laugh once throughout this short , and it 's a Bugs Bunny cartoon , for Christ 's sake ! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny , not boring ! Alas , this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer \( another incredibly boring Jones short \) with the addition of Bugs Bunny br br The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff This cartoon , on the other hand , is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon there 's too much dialogue The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve , but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue At one point , Elmer finishes eating dinner , and comments , That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb , possibly the most redundant dialogue I 've ever heard in a cartoon \( characters reading text out loud in the later era Woody Woodpecker cartoons does n't count in my book \) Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long , it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this br br Elmer 's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me , but if you 've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career , you might enjoy it 
A grade Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low budget gory mayhem His movies are full of inept gore , laughable acting , boring sub plots and woeful dialogue A mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless You do n't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters The pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting The acting is merely competent , but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed A generous 4 out of 10 Just beware do not mistake Monson 's film with Andy Milligan 's equally weak Legacy of Blood 
This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a too small part Despite this I found it to be nearly unwatchable Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for Downey 's character 's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it 's portrayed The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film , having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so br br Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply do n't get it I do n't think this is so The plot was not complicated or beyond understanding It was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured I got it I just did n't like it Paddy Breathnach 's I Went Down and Guy Ritchie 's Snatch and Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of film making that director Shane Black fails to achieve br br I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits \( mostly as a screenwriter \) makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection 
This movie is n't terrible , really Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans snicker at But there are those , and not necessarily Anglo Saxon yahoos , who do not care for Frenchmen and the Xavier character is n't going to sway them br br Let 's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes br br 1 \) Cynical very cynical Check br br 2 \) Reedy , underfed appearance , check , despite br br 3 \) A great appreciation of cuisine Check br br 4 \) Lukewarm work ethic Check \( Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker , from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks \) br br 5 \) Beautiful wife , check Despite that br br 6 \) Loose interpretation of the marriage vows Check br br 7 \) Big sexual ego , which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner Check br br Whether Mo is a hick or not , there 's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so br br On the other hand , as other male reviewers have , I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen 's cute , petite body I 'll give the movie four stars two of them are for that 
A pot boiler if ever I saw one A supposed thriller borrowing from A Time to Kill , Silence of the Lambs , even an inverted In the Heat of the Night with a little reverse murder , a la Strangers on a Train thrown in , it fails abysmally where all the above , to a large degree , succeeded Namely , in delivering thrills The plot seems condensed from a bigger book , making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving , while the direction lacks pace and verve To rein in any kudos , a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age , barely bothering with his attempt at a US accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those gosh darn kids of his He even has a father in law who seems younger than him Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you 're confused from the outset as to whether he 's a bad guy or a good guy Someone once said that flashbacks should n't lie they do , confusedly , here The rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles The supposed climax managed too , to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back , not as should have been the aim , front edge of my seat Mediocre sloppy Hollywood film making for sure 
I may not be a critic , but here is what I think of this movie Well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all I just have to say how much I hate the storyline I mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids , secondly it is pretty gory but I bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS BOMB ! ! ! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much 
I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck The concept of the film was n't very good to start with This movie has so many bad things about it I do n't know where to start The acting is horrible The cinematography is marginal at best The soundtrack was pretty bad The score is terrible There 's a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 I voted before I wrote this and I cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this film is excellent They must have liked the two go go dancers Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again ! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves 
Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars The acting is weak and uninspiring , the story even weaker The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith Not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it 's wholesomeness and it 's religious leanings and who can blame them However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking 
I have to confess that I am severely disappointed br br This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995 The reason why I watched it was that I was n't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book And he was too br br Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film The rest is as un Austen like as possible br br Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this It was n't in her character and it just was n't done by a lady of the those times The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst br br Although there are 3 important quotes from the book , they are at entirely inappropriate moments , warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed br br And although this version is not much shorter than the other one , it feels like everything is rushed Very little care was taken to introduce the characters , show their dispositions and motives Important scenes were omitted How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way \? A disaster ! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one br br No , no , no If you love Austen , then do n't waste your time with this 
Another FINE effort by America 's most UNDERrated filmmaker His knowledge on the subject of racism is STAGGERING , and IMPRESSES me on more than one level Accusations that Lee is really just a devious little racist , a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood 's Affirmative Action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter NONSENSE , mere Right Wing propaganda The very notion that Lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in America in order to produce hate filled anti white movies is simply FALSE and malicious br br Some of Lee 's detractors even go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African Americans , while putting down other races obviously , another FALSEHOOD disseminated by people who are AGAINST peaceful co existence between different races in America and elsewhere br br My favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black Republican and the others in the bus The views presented by that man are simply WRONG all across the board 100 UNTRUE He LACKS education , unlike the brilliantly INFORMED guys who quite DESERVEDLY throw him off the bus br br TERRIFIC performances , and an INTELLIGENT script make for a viewing experience that has been RARELY rivaled by any political movies made since br br I also want to point out the incessant LIES that the Million Man March had only 80 , 000 people taking part in it ! br br \( And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters \) br br So what message does Lee send here \? If someone does n't agree with your political views , you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus I thought the movie said get ON the bus \? br br Apparently , Mr Lee is for bus segregation after all , i e is no different than those KKK lunatics before him the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the Democratic Party 's line of thinking So much for freeing the slaves br br The end credits This movie was entirely financed by black people And distributed and marketed by a major Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites whom Farrakhan despises 
I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga , compelling storyline , cool soundtrack , directing \( Kitamura rocks ! \) , editing , and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 , but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket \( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off , however these are completely 2 different movies The pace is a lot slower , the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise \( if that is possible ! \) I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off Even the real bad guys , get killed off too easily without too much of a fight The fight with the Spider guy \( straight out of an episode of Monkey ! \) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam ! ! Azumi 's rampage at the end was unconvincing , but Aya still does an okay job She looks great in the cape but where did she get it from \? I do n't think i will be watching this one over and over again ! what a pity

'I do n't understand None of this makes any sense ! ' , exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie , I know exactly how he feels The story , by the film 's director Aristide Massacessi \( good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change \) , is a clumsy mix of the supernatural , murder mystery , and pretentious arty rubbish , the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco 's more bizarre efforts , but which had me struggling to remain conscious br br Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister \( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair , before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor \) , Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman \( played by Ewa Aulin , who stars in the equally strange 'Death Laid an Egg' \) is seen alive and kicking , the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbr ck After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home , where she is tended to by creepy Dr Sturges \( Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role \) , the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr and Mrs Ravensbr ck \( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin' \) br br 'So far , so good' , I thought to myself at this point , 'we 've had hunchbacks , incest , some blood and guts , and gratuitous female nudity' all ingredients of a great trashy Euro horror what follows , however , is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings , ghostly goings on , and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe 's 'The Black Cat' , to tell a very silly , utterly bewildering , and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave br br This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb , but given the choice , I would much rather watch one of the director 's sleazier movies from later in his career I guess incomprehensible , meandering , surreal 70s Gothic horror just ai n't my thing ! 2 5 out of 10 \( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness \) , rounded up to 3 for IMDb 
I 've read some of the other comments and I do have to agree with the ones that did n't get the ending I thought it was going rather well until the end It kept your mind running and then splat I have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess It 's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised First they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about Area 51 \( which makes you think about aliens \) then after they it went to crap I thought the actors and actresses did fine it 's just the script went sour Anyways , if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end 
My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan I like him too , but have generally found that he should stick to what he does best and focus on comedic roles My thoughts were confirmed with this movie I was completely bored throughout the entire film The story was predictable I realize it was inspired by a true story But , my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story None of the characters were well developed There was a side story about the main character and his partner This relationship could have been explored further More important , though , would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the boy Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way If my husband was n't such a huge Williams fan , we would have left 20 minutes into it Too bad I ca n't get my 20 or 2 hours back 
Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time There are a lot of films I do n't like which , for some unfathomable reason , I 've felt the urge to review However , if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film I 've ever seen , look no further than Transylvania 6 5000 Without question , this takes the title of the all time no 1 awful film I ca n't believe that I actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish ! br br It is clearly meant to capture the flavour of Mel Brooks 's Young Frankenstein , but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions , this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania \( perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud \) During their research , they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites , such as vampires , werewolves and mummies br br Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way , it results in awesomely dire entertainment 
Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary Full Moon entertainment Sadly , his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years However , in his short career Hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories Now , this does n't mean that his movies are good , but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre br br In his debut , Bleed , Hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre Maddy \( Debbie Rochon \) is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams Not only that , but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in Shaun \( Danny Wolske \) , it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events Until on a party with Shaun 's friends , they tell her that they created a club where members have to kill somebody to enter br br Obviously they are joking , but Maddy wants desperately to fit in , that she actually murders someone After that event , someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the club one by one it is up to Maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer , including her br br Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon It is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects The concept is so original and Rochon 's performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton did n't develop the whole story a little bit better The movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie br br The rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good , while the male cast is painfully bad Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical Julie Strain , Brinke Stevens Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles Also , there is lots of nudity \( both male female \) and the cast is very good looking , so it is really a plus br br The low budget hurts the film in the effects department , as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic \( probably because they would look bad \) nevertheless , considering the budget , the film at least looks good br br Hamilton 's more recent effort , the sexploitational venture Delta Delta Die ! , is a better crafted and overall funnier film While this one is not as bad as other better known films , it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent no budget films 4 10
Frequently voted China 's greatest film ever by Chinese critics , as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside , and , frankly , I do n't get it at all What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable , blandly directed and acted , with a complete shrew for a protagonist Wei Wei \( do n't laugh \) is that shrew , a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband \( Yu Shi \) for the past several years It is post WWII , and they live with the husband 's teenage sister \( Hongmei Zhang \) in a dilapidated home with not much money \( the man had been wealthy when they married \) Along comes the husband 's old best friend \( Wei Li \) , who also used to be the wife 's boyfriend when they were teens She considers running away from her husband with this man , while the husband pretty much remains oblivious , thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend That 's the set up , and it does n't go anywhere you would n't expect it to I 've actually seen the remake , directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian It runs a half hour longer , and is actually kind of dull , too , but at least it was pretty This supposed classic is pretty intolerable 
Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women to have been on Saturday Night Live It 's unfortunate that they , along with Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph , were on SNL during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch making \( circa 2002 2006 \) the show has ever had Still , these two women most especially know what 's funny , and they know how to write a funny movie br br You 'll notice in the credits of this movie that Dratch and director Ryan Shiraki wrote the story for Spring Breakdown , but who wrote the actual screenplay , consisting of dialogue and all the important fill in the blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie \? Yep , just Shiraki Just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie , and no women apparently wrote the script with him The result is a pretty clich spring break movie that does n't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as MTV does every year br br If Dratch , Poehler , and even co star Parker Posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay , it would have been far less clich The premise is original , being about three thirty something women who were unpopular in high school \( and apparently college , too \) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about I say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters They entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro woman anthems like True Colors , and spend their nights together holding make your own pizza parties Even though none of them are especially unattractive , the outside world appears to treat them like they are There 's a scene where a blind student of Poehler 's \( played by Poehler 's real life husband Will Arnett \) asks her out on a date , only to touch her face and immediately change his mind If Poehler 's character is supposed to be unattractive , they obviously hired the wrong actress br br The movie continues to show promise , even though we have our doubts about the main characters , when Posey 's boss , Texas Senator 'Kay Bee' Hartmann \( Jane Lynch , funny as always \) hires Posey to watch over her unpopular college age daughter \( Amber Tamblyn , playing yet another woman who 's attractive in real life , but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie \) while she goes to a Laguna Beach like vacation spot for Spring Break Poehler and Dratch come along , they reluctantly get boozed up , party like they apparently should have when they were in college , and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by Sophie Monk br br Sophie Monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons Unfortunately , her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny Date Movie \( 2006 \) and the disappointing Click \( 2006 \) Here , she plays a Southern belle , although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burke 's voice box She hams it up a little too much , trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras br br Spring Breakdown was released straight to DVD despite the star power of Amy Poehler , but rightly so because the story is way too clich It may as well have been called National Lampoon 's Spring Breakdown , and the magazine probably would n't have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity If director Shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input , especially Rachel Dratch , this movie would have been great and not nearly as run of the mill as frat house comedies we 've seen before I know Dratch will come up with another funny concept , and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself She 's funny enough , and she deserves better than this half baked comedy that would accept Stiffler 's brother with open arms 
The plot of Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutating monster died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the Earth 's orbit does n't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent sci fi movie to use the idea So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start Alas watching THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN it seems the plot is the least of its problems br br First of all this is an incredibly badly made movie The budget is in single figures and I'm talking about lira not dollars There is no cinematography to speak of and there 's countless editing blunders For example a photographer takes his \( Barely legal \) model for a photo shoot Cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him , then cut back to the model where the sun is br br The lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could n't get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors would n't be employed by a porn studio If I was appearing in this I would n't be scared by the eponymous monster I 'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes A general for instance does n't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap br br There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level The tone is set early on in the film where Mr Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital Instead of the police getting a call saying there 's been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he 'd look for a missing cat It 's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there 's a monster on the loose br br THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is Z grade rubbish I can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of It 's so bad it 's good but apart from Rick Baker 's sometimes impressive make up effects it 's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure
 the first film I had to walk out on And it was the cast and crew pre screening \( Not that I was involved , I hasten to add \) I made it through the first hour , so I reckon I'm just qualified to comment , but that was my limit br br Like other comments here , how did this get through any kind of QA An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue , the epitome of wooden acting , awful casting , all wrapped together without a plot br br Tara Fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre , almost comic She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history br br As I left the screening , the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema They obviously could n't sit through it again either br br 
What a piece of junk this movie was The premise was okay , but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people \( even the effects in Hercules was better \) I knew this would be bad But the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs It 's completely incoherent , silly and stupid I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through br br I 've had my share of cheesy and bad movies \( I love the tremors series \) , but this I do not recommend it at all It 's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe 
Where do they get the money to make films like this \? I mean , there 's nothing redeeming about this film None of the actors are known , the writing is terrible , the photography is blurry , the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable For someone who watches all kinds of film , good and bad , I must admit that this film is about the worst I 've seen since Attack of the Eye People back in the 50 's I do n't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or , heaven forbid , art but this film would seem to appeal to no one The story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who 's a bad version of the Celtic Soul eater , although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones The bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from Take it from there as that , alas , is the best part My advice is that unless you are into bad mythology , amateurish writing , unconvincing acting and tedious settings , you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you 're out renting videos 
This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences This movie was the man 's version of Mommy Dearest It depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God br br Someone told me it was funny No way , I say ! It is sick humor at best br br The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room The best use for this movie is for people who do n't understand mental illness or do n't believe what we families actually do live through 
This film , by Oscar Petersson , is unique Its uniqueness does n't lie in the story , since many a half brained Hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots , but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects br br The dialog is worse than embarrassing Rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix Bosnians speaking English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor Uninspired lightning and camera work are icing on the turkey film cake As a sort of surprise for the audience , there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you 'd least expect any To add insult to injury , the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing br br The bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy 's speech scene in the church , is the point at which is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position as the worst director of all times Move over Ed Wood here comes Oscar Petersson ! 
Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap Billed as a horror flick , there was n't one scene , not one , that was even remotely scarey NOT ONE ! ! Sure there was some nudity , but all the lesbian action got a little old I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie 's saving grace \? And Dan , what an annoying ass bag ! ! Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol' Dan first spoke And he was suppose to be intimidating \? What a laugh ! ! All in all , this movie is dreadfully awful ! How in the hell do movies like this get made \? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it , do n't rent this one This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies 
I do n't think any player in Hollywood history lasted as long as David Niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm He could act , got an Oscar for it , but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper br br Happy Go Lovely is a case in point It 's a musical and for the most part you 'll remember Vera Ellen 's dancing You 'll remember that they are in Scot 's costume as the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival But if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory br br The plot is light Vera Ellen is the American lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in Edinburgh She starts in the chorus and runs late one day She gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king Everybody now assumes she 's the main squeeze of the millionaire Doors open up as they 've never opened before br br The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical br br In the end though Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff which David Niven did so much of and got so tired of 
What a disappointment ! br br This film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy , sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition Jack Black 's acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting The soundtrack was tedious We are \( WERE \) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake \? br br We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first ! ! br br Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel \? 
I ca n't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 !

While some scenes of training were realistic , too many of them depicted military instructors as ex Nazi types Obviously , the people who wrote the screen play were either anti military types or writing a film for that audience br br I am a Viet Nam vet and , even during this period , military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison br br And I really loved the scene where the hero and his buddy \( both privates \) are sitting down in the Captain 's office , smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the Captain as if he were their buddy This sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation , as was the purpose for the scene br br At the end I asked myself , What was this film about \? as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except I hate all authority Thank God I got it from the library and did not pay to rent it

I read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie Jeez , this movie was predictable and pretty boring The acting was below average most of the time , especially by Mckenna I have n't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone badass in a movie Oh man , this movie was a letdown I also read somewhere this might be a cult classic I know there are followers of the director , but this movie was just a average piece of film br br The script was lame , for the most part the acting was lame , this movie was lame br br Oh and pray for the guy that used to be in Cheers He looks really bad br br The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space , and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes br br 4 10
Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie , \( I one of them \) the stooges just are n't given any material to work with It is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with Curly , and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny , when it could have had great potential Awful musical numbers do n't help any either The short they did with the same title has more laughs 
This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke I personally do n't care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her Just as a movie this is something that would n't even get a passing grade in film school The script is a mess , the acting is atrocious , and the fact Luke Wilson \( co writer of Bottle Rocket \) did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking He did Old School for crying out loud ! This does n't even belong in the same state as my Old School DVD ! Please for whatever reason DO NOT WATCH THIS ! I see there is a comment that this is so bad it 's good , but that frankly is too kind When will we stop seeing singers that obviously ca n't act keep trying to , I hope ends soon The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors \( Penelope Ann Miller , Rachel Leigh Cook , Luke Wilson \) who are part of this dump As far as the plot , well it is almost non existent and so poorly done and written \( yes I know it 's another rehash \) I very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this Please whatever you do do n't waste your time , but if you do , feel sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb Jessica Simpson you 're pretty , but stick to singing , although I'm not much a fan of that either And whoever did this film , I would n't put this on your resume 1 10 because you ca n't give a zero

To me this just comes off as a soap opera I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered social commentary But in the final analysis , I simply do n't care how you characterize this film None of the characters are very likable or engaging I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall If there is a love story here , it is lost in the malaise And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate \( and therefore , incomprehensible \) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand , the story is insufficient to hold my interest No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in , this story is sleazy , melodramatic and trite br br Rock Hudson is nobly wooden This is Lauren Bacall 's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances , but her character is vile , and his is pathetic Robert Keith , as the loving , out of touch father of two miscreant adult children , is the most sympathetic character Most interesting of all , however , is the severe looking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns , but here he is an honest , likable fellow br br I take my social commentary with an interesting , engaging story and a few likable characters , thank you

`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone' ish manner The general rule applies here and this sequel does n't match up to its predecessor Worse than that , it does n't even compare with it br br `Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream Immediately after that , the film nose dives After a disastrous first 45 minutes , it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14 minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan worthy twist at the end Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot , but it 's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music br br The bullet time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition , but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring In the first one there were interesting plot turns , but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting The movie is basically , just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have br br The acting standard is poor for the most part The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving 's `Agent Smith' the only one to be slightly interesting Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo , but in all the special effects , there is little room to make much of an impact Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress br br A poor , thrown together movie , `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment Those who did n't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it This one 's for die hard fans only Even in the movie 's own sub genre of special effect bonanzas \( Minority Report , The Matrix etc \) this is still rather poor My IMDb rating 4 5 10 
Watch the 1936 version As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer 's voice , he 's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan , depressed Rudolf I mean Omar Sharif tries but , no too cute and vibrant Catherine Denueve \( sp \) besides being too old looks nothing like Marie nothing ! She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion br br The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they 're playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief \( and look up pictures of the empress there 's more than a passing resemblance \) as historically , Empress Elisabeth was n't involved that much in Rudolf 's life 
From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu I'm so wooden I could be a Plank me Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites \( pun not intended \) The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment \( which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist' \) Wish I 'd spent the 3 99 it cost me on something else , like erm Natural Born Killers Directors Cut If you do buy this , you 're really in for a disappointment , do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague If you 're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere , like Dog Soldiers , Wolfen , Romasanta The werewolf Hunt 
This sequel is a total rehash of the first film A completely pointless movie It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time It even ends the same way as the first one ! The music is too busy and interfering , and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I , it 's extremely predictable It 's not a horrible movie , it 's not terribly made , there is much worse movies out there , this just had absolutely no point in being made The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse , even more pointless than this , so I guess it has that If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke , I guess I 'd choose this 
Robert Altman 's downbeat , new fangled western from Edmund Naughton 's book McCabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following Aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario , the characters here do n't merit much interest , and the picture looks \( intentionally \) brackish and unappealing Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn of the century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in , Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action Altman creates a solemn , wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place , but the action in this sorry little town is limited most of the story being made up of vignettes and Altman 's pacing is deliberately slow There 's hardly a statement being made \( just the opposite , in fact \) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds It 's a self defeating picture , and yet , in an Altman quirky way , it wears defeat proudly from 
Needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry br br I do n't recall ever walking out on a movie before , but I really tried to stay The script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly come on ! Uma Thurman doing this stuff \? Fairly lame special effects These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20 something lives just sort of annoying and wrong feeling br br This review is base only on the first hour it might have gotten better I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on 
I 've always been enthusiastic about period dramas , an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past This presentation of Byron was unbelievable Unbelievably bad ! The script was dreadful , the acting uninspired , and all the characters woefully insipid Apparently Byron was mad bad and dangerous to know , and set the ladies hearts all a flutter Not in this production Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence It is said that Byron walked with a limp This portrayal of the man was just limp all over br br I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life Not a splutter , not even a glimmer It was utter tedium , if not downright boredom , from start to finish br br Having the opinion that no one will ever better the Bard of Avon , I also believe that Byron 's poetry is over revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner , and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment br br I think the BBC lost its nous with this one
This is a horrid disaster of a film From beginning to end , it 's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand , because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson 's character at his peak or Streisand 's character struggling The first should be seen in decline and the second rising The final Streisand number could have been one of the greatest finales in film , if it was directed and edited properly The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake Had the band , audience and wide shots of the stage been shown , this number could have been dynamic and interesting This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film , and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions 
This is one of the most god awful movies ever Shaq better just stick to basketball This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back I will make fun of this movie until I die , and then some It is so horrible it is not even funny MST3000 would have a blast with this one 
Stupid , mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes \( piloted by Burgess Meredith \) chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decades old gasoline sludge , driven by Lee Majors , with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno wiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously , and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society As moronic as it sounds Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith , but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film

Now , I 've seen a lot of bad movies I like bad movies Especially bad action movies I 've seen \( and enjoyed \) all of Jean Claude Van Damme 's movies , including the one where he 's his own clone , both of the ones where he plays twins , and all three where he 's a cyborg I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians \( Hey , if nothing else , he 's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it With DVD , you can even pause and zoom in ! \) That 's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad , it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane br br Everything about Snake Eater is bad The plot is bad The script is bad The sets are bad The fights are bad The stunts are bad The FX are bad The acting is spectacularly , earth time bendingly bad , very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast , including Lorenzo Lamas , and that 's really saying something And I 'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed , to boot ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas br br It does manage to be unintentionally funny , so it 's not a total loss However , I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very , very stoned I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry br br It did n't help much , but it was better than nothing One point for Ron Palillo 's cameo as a gay arsonist 
I purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental , thinking that the cover looked quite nice And it was nice , but the movie is trash I can handle B grade , I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp \( ie 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be \) , but this was just bland bland bland Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences This movie has very little to offer 
After 30 seconds , you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock off The story is taken from great movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hills have Eyes I like those kind of movies , even if they 're duplicated well \( Wrong Turn , Timber Falls , Carver \) br br But Side Sho is hard to watch the actors are really bad , the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced You do not care at all what happens to the characters The so called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical So how about the blood and gore \? Well there is some , although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly 2 Points , just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look , even for the gore hounds 
Working with one of the best Shakespeare sources , this film manages to be creditable to it 's source , whilst still appealing to a wider audience br br Branagh steals the film from under Fishburne 's nose , and there 's a talented cast on good form 
This is one of those cheaply made TV Movies were the characters seem to lose all sense The premise of the story , the kidnapping of a son by the boy 's father , is very good But the story just seems to beggar belief Whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it It is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing 
Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life This time the target audience is preteen girls , the fact of life is menstruation This animated film , created by Walt Disney Pictures , apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex br br It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body , especially the ovaries , uterus and vagina , work and why this all leads to menstruation It is almost amazing , becoming the comic note here , how the subject of sex is avoided Even the word is never mentioned although furtilized will pass once I do n't really know why I saw this , but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time , you might want to give it a try 
The only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the 0 end of the movie rating scale Now if I see a movie that really stinks I say this movie was a real Pecker I believe this movie is a perfect example of Christina Ricci 's one dimensional acting Horrible
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad acting bad plot bad casting bad directing bad cinematography if they had set out to make a bad picture they could n't have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood do n't waste your time ! 
Sean , you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world , but I ca n't commend you for this Comedy just is n't your strong suit br br However , it was n't all your fault Some of the stuff was just too hard to understand Alfred Lynch did a decent job , but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning br br Once again , Sean I apologize 
I do not envy Barry Levinson , Rachel Weisz , Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film It 's , in one word , boring Maybe the fact that is too predictable , the more than exploited Ben Stiller 's loser role or the not at all funny scenes make this film just something to forget Even Christopher Walken 's appearance finishes in a pathetic way I was very disappointed I love Ben Stiller 's acting I loved it in most of his films , the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad About Jack Black Well , apart from High Fidelity I 've never seen him doing something good What about School of Rock \? Ooops , frightening 
Hey everyone br br There really is n't much to say for this movie at all The basic plot is that a guy \( Brandon \) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work After picking up a girl on the way there , things start going badly wrong for all of them br br The storyline alone \( written by the actor playing Brandon , I believe , although I could be wrong here \) is unlikely and unconvincing , and is acted out accordingly The Clown Killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer Far from being a dark , mysterious but most of all , intelligent predator , we are instead offered a rather clumsy , nursery rhyme singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film \( the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things \) br br In short , this film falls below every possible set standard Admittedly , I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this , so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S I C K did fall just shy of a two rating However , in reality , \( and with the benefit of hindsight \) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film br br 1 star out of ten 
Laughed a lot because it is so incredibly bad sorry folks , but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen I know it is low budget , but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies , but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished But at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay and the score was really worth listening to The DVD cover promised a lot , but that is by far the best this film has to offer 
I hired out Hybrid on the weekend What a disappointment ! A stupid lame attempt at a tele movie The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running he did a lot looked like he was eating those minty sweets with his backside ! The wolf contacts he wore were great , though I feel the actor relied on them too much , as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all The wise native American Indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen Talk about a sour cow ! She smiled about once for the entire film , and I think that is because she had sex The sex scene was lame too They may as well have shown blowing curtains , if you can dig that br br Last of all , and this is a big pet hate of mine , on the cover and the DVD menu , the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy They were nowhere to be seen in the film \( 
My goodness is this movie bad I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage Yeah , yeah , good guys wear white , bad guys wear black and the good guys always win Now go home and hug your kids , and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel Blech ! I ca n't believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage , so he made this piece of dung It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director br br Ya see , a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he 's gonna hurt her daddy But being Ms All American girl next door , we know she 's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys the end Girl power ROCKS br br C'mon now , only an idiot would find this entertaining a roller coaster ride , let alone something fresh or new All those super duper reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick , paying back a favor , or they have sold their souls to the devil br br Rachael McAdams is beautiful yup , that 's it Not a good performance , not a horrible one she 's just cute She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie She is n't tough enough to be a good female action lead br br Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' McAdams , because after all , she was a cheerleader and a field hockey player and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire I would n't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7 11 br br Ya see , this movie was done before , except before they did it well Go re rent any of the Die Hard movies You have loved ones in danger , international terrorists , except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting I simply do n't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy No wonder movie revenues are down br br Throw your 6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you 'll never get back br br ciao , FreddyShoop
After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20 's music and the scratchiness of the sound track I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so it was the Director br br I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film These days , directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique Unfortunately , no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same br br So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film \( which you can find out for yourself elsewhere \) the sound track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound track and certainly not a cat 's meow 
This is a film where the actors are all fine , especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino , in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion In other words , it feels like they are contrived movie scenes , not like real life Even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers , it just does n't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film Also , when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film , it feels artificial , the way they look at each other seconds after arguing Again , the actors are all good , and moments of this film are nice , but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling 
This piece ai n't really worth a comment It 's simply the worst horror movie i have ever seen The actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry Shame on you I say ! ! 
What the hell of a D Movie was that \? Bad acting , bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across The only cool thing here was Coolio , who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop However , the rest of the film is awful and boring It 's not even so bad , you can laugh about it Just plain crap And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones \( well , ok , at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider \) ! 1 out of 10
I will start this off by saying I could n't get all the way through it I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site I figured there was n't any way I would regret my purchase Was I wrong or what \? Seriously now , who approved this project \? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity That 's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam The acting isnt much better I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos Yay , who cares Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny , and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser That 's about as much of the plot as I understood br br Overall it 's the worst movie I 've ever seen I own it on DVD and have given it to many co workers to watch Each comes back and laughs and says Wow I didnt think I 'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in br br My response is always Well now you can br br 
An uninspired and undistinguished new Columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his nephew 's wedding , only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night Columbo investigates br br And that it is about it indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script , given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk , who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story Murder Under Glass in the detective 's heyday there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding , which include everybody who was there ! br br Devoid of every Columbo trait possible , I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues An insult to the history of the series , with appropriately soap opera style acting Very avoidable stuff 
Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines Just by watching House , I solved two \( out of nine \) medical mysteries before the doctors did Boooring Seriously , if you are a lazy writer , why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap \? House is recent and popular recycling their ideas is hard to get away with br br Second biggest complaint these people are supposed to be forty somethings , right \? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15 year olds \? Is three weeks \( ie three whole damn episodes \) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend does n't want to be your friend with benefits , it 's maybe not because he wants to hurt you , but because he does n't want to risk your friendship \? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you ca n't really buy into the supposed drama br br And I wo n't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone 's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey 's Anatomy On a sidenote , do n't you think it 's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete \( sorry , but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart 's Requiem is a loser , PhD or not \) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny , irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle \? Apart from that little fling with Mark , they seemed to be perfect for each other Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships , our first choice is often the right one 
I have to admit that I'm a great fan of this show , so you must know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie First of all , the plot was awful , I thought it was going to be something more interesting , like to see what happened to Arnold fathers , or something more interesting , but NOOOOOOO , a maniac wants to destroy Arnold 's house , between many other places , so many people tries to stop this br br I must admit that the plot was n't so bad after all , but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac , they become friends of a spy , they drive a bus \( based on a video game , for God sake \) , and to worse everything , they make super moves on the bus , things that many persons had already tried and died , but not Arnold , Gerald and Helga , 'cause they are experts on a video game br br Honestly , my mom , my sister , even me got really disappointed after watching this movie , 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon I must admit that I used to enjoy Hey Arnold ! , it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon , but after this crap of movie , I'm not quite sure if I'm going to watch Hey Arnold ! as I used to watch it on the past br br Other thing Nickelodeon , with that enormous number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple street would explode , I think that the whole city could explode with that , oh , and please , if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that , do n't do more movies , you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good br br Honestly , I think this was the worst way to end this show , a good show transformed into this crap of movie 
This really is one of the worst movies ever made I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting , lame special effects a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies , AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere story suspension or whatever to offer This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate , maybe worse Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week s holiday and definitely did a better job \( no zombie film though \) br br This flick is not even funny , not speaking of anything else Really bad and redundant special effects , zombies that look like normal people \( except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces \) , WAY TO MUCH fake blood \( I like realism a lot , the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable , but the presented gore is just plain silly \) The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes , it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder , why the zombies use WEAPONS \( ! \) to kill their prey I will not go into the details of the dubbing \( others have done so \) Although I am from Germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version , I will NOT waste more of my time with this movie br br Keep away from it , as far as you can 
i went into watching this movie knowing it was n't going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i do n't mean to be harsh , its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad , i mean AWFUL special effects , the acting was n't too bad , but was n't good either , and sasquatch himself was like well , not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons its not violent or horror , but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some half ass cgi rip off only see this movie if you are desperate , or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints , it is MUCH better 
 Gone With The Wind is one of the most overrated movies in history It is a film loved by mothers , grandmothers , and shut ins who go to the movies once every five years As a zombie movie , it blows There is n't a shambling corpse in sight , and it 's terribly light in the gore department Zombie 3 , on the other hand , is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood spilling therefore , it is better than Gone With the Wind It is also not overrated Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish It is , however , not boring rubbish After a terrorist steals a virus , he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter , and the chemicals leak into the ground The terrorist , who has been exposed to the nasty concoction , hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh eating zombie One of his first victim 's is a cleaning lady Once she 's bitten , Lucio Fulci 's brand of hell breaks loose As usual for a Fulci flick , the acting is atrocious , the storyline is riddled with plot holes , and the gore is plentiful Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei , so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature It is badly shot , too , poorly edited , and the sound design is flat Still , it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing Definitely worth picking up if you 're an undead completest Or do n't like Gone With The Wind , undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time 
I thought Hedy Burress \( who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one \) was going to be in part 2 Guess not I just think they should of killed her off like in Friday The 13th Part 2 \( you know what I mean \) br br This movie like Scream 3 , and Urban Legend 2 followed movies within a movie br br This was PURE CRAP ! The whole Movie within a Movie crap br br BAD STAY AWAY ! 
The original show was so much better They should have left on a good note This movie killed the whole idea It was boring , over dramatic , and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack This movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious , and that was definitely not what I was wanting from this sequel Not to mention , that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again So , sorry , Tyler Perry , but try harder next time This movie is just kinda dull , and not that funny either Sorry 4 10 stars is it br br Jay Addison
I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this , but come on ! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S t I have ever seen ! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror , but I got bored and turned it off Let 's see br br The wardrobe Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot The masks were made from what looks like tin foil br br The Gore The Gore was pretty good , I must give it that But Ittenbach 's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie br br Acting Was horrible ! I did n't mind the dubbing I find this humorous like in Ittenbach 's Premutos \( great movie \) The fighting and action sequences were pi poor br br Bottom line Do n't watch any of Schnaas 's movies There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter Check Premutos , House of blood , Schramm and the nekromantiks 
Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this , one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title , THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN , and there have been many home video versions of it over the years If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though , the most workable edition I 've seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS , and it 's an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURY 's print It is also letterboxed br br Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky , returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he 's contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form , but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant Apparently , the doc attempts to tame the werewolf , and there is a very strange sado masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who is under her trance , at least in the original version Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a she wolf ! br br The biggest problem with the movie is that the director \( according to Naschy 's claims \) was often drunk , and the results are indeed rather incoherent When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy , it 's not quite as difficult to make out what 's going on , though the editing remains atrocious in spots Worst of all is occasional non matching footage of Naschy 's ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film \( LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO , aka FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR \) and mixed into this one without any sensible reason ! The wolf 's clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again , as does his demeanor one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from FURY , next he is growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR Really bizarre 
The film is poorly casted , except for some familiar old Hollywood names Other performances by unknown names \( i e , Jennifer Gabrielle \) are uninspiring I have seen other films by this director , unfortunately this is one of his worst Perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay \? br br In a positive note , Kim Bassinger 's and Pat Morita 's performance saved the movie from oblivion I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid , though There are many good movies to see , and in short , this one is not one of them Save your money and the celluloid br br Jason Vanness
As some other comments show , this movie might scare you , when you 're a little child \( And that is probably all that it is good for \) br br However , if you 're older , this movie only does one thing suck majorly and thereby I do n't mean the acting , its soundtrack , cutting or s th like that I'm simply talking about the plot \( if you can call it that \) br br SPOILERS ahead br br I do n't want to give any more spoilers than necessary \( if after reading this , you really still want to watch this movie \) but if you graduated from any school , this is just a big insult of your intelligence When watching this , I was stunned most of the time , because what was happening was just THAT stupid br br This includes br br the forming of UNITE \( an evil UN association \) br br we are just supposed to believe it 's evil is it even evil at all \? if so why is it evil \? br br the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo br br there is no necessity to impose this on the people , so why the hell \( no pun intended \) are they doing it \? br br inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service br br because there 's nothing anybody , who in this movie is considered a real Christian , ever does , besides saying that stupid prayer so just say that prayer before the rapture and you 're saved no matter what \? ! br br Thus , rating 1 10
This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0 10 The acting is awful , even what some here have lauded , the Carpathia character ! The script looks like it was written in haste In one scene , the black preacher who was left behind , when asked by Buck what dan7 in the computer graphic meant , said , Daniel 7 , CHAPTER 24 He probably meant VERSE 24 , but the film makers missed this slip up Perhaps the worst part is that the film 's eschatological position is Biblically unsound While many Christians have espoused the film 's interpretation of end time events , such interpretation , in my opinion , is faulty To understand these flaws , read Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation by Jim McKeever and The Blessed Hope , A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture by George E Ladd 
The hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U S because most of them that viewed it could n't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable br br Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone Godspeed this makes it a Christian movie \? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the Land of Plenty with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe \? Plenty of useless homeless missions \? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets \? As a pill popping delusional survivor of agent pink are we to think America is a Land of Plenty of paranoid patriots \? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients \? Certainly we do n't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the Continent of Plenty when it comes to sophistication br br Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the Land of Plenty and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films Life is too short and one , even an American , does n't have plenty of time to waste watching this piece 
With movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts Eva as a ghost is pretty funny And the other actors also do a good job It is the direction and the story that is lacking That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better The problem only is that there are n't many jokes Sure I laughed a couple of times Apart from the talking parrot there was n't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie I blame the director not using the premise to it 's full potential Eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so Overall this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon Other than that it can be skipped completely 
Now I get it The title refers to each audience member 's immediate post reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture Trying too hard to be terrifying , lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes The Screaming Skull more like A Snoring Dull Albeit , the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie , but that 's about it The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this ! Remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning \? That may be the funniest thing I have ever witnessed on screen Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin , nailed shut , and buried alive for his lame effort Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted , cranial receptacle Also , her husband John comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker , but this does n't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around ! Ah , Mickey the days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him This guy 's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue Still , despite his strange persona , Mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and I ca n't get enough of a guy saying It was Mary ! and rummaging through pots in a greenhouse 
I just rented and watched this movie just to see what 's all the fuss about So here 's what my reactions to it are It 's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film However , the movie does n't shock or disturb me at all It just bored me This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time , like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below br br Contains spoiler I find the rape scenes quite tame I do n't know if I have watched the cut or uncut version , if there is actually such a version I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot Here 's a list on top of my mind br br Why do n't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are That would be an excellent time br br Why do n't they just gang rape her , instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer 's ordeal by such a long time It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way br br I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles br br These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right , they should n't send a coward imbecile to do the job br br Why did n't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left \? Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people 's mind , especially for someone who is a writer br br Why did n't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive \? br br I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him Ends spoiler br br But hey , this movie is not without its merits , Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer , `Why me \? Why Me , I did n't even c m ! ! ! '
3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer moody deep doctor Unlike House he has absolutely no personality and unlike Grey 's Anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting This programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for Neurlogical cases yet there 's nothing interesting or exciting going on ! Not even the so called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads 's social life as a father snooze ! boring and pointless br br This show is pants , there 's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special 
it aint bad , but it aint good it is just entertaining br br as a comedy which it is supposed to be , it 's dreadful not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before br br it 's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually , but none of them really do much and the ending sucks 
I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing Last Days and some Charlie Chaplin films Based on the quality of the other features , I decided to give Immortel a chance I nearly walked out of this movie , and I LIKE science fiction ! The story is set in a futuristic New York city , filled with Blade Runner style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning synthetic humans Unfortunately , the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie Three groups exist in this world humans , artificial humans , and Egyptian gods The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid \( modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu , and complete with a deteriorated exterior , leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid Would n't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition \? \) The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it 's there I wo n't bore you with the so called plot , but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes The film , as I said , looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner , and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix At the end of the film credits were listed thank yous to the United Kingdom , France , and Italy The film is FRENCH , but uses British actors who do n't speak French Hence , it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed This is a distraction , and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting It does n't help that the animations are poor no better than a video game Skip this one 
This is a bad , bad movie I'm an actual fencer trust me when I say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that This is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop The ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish Horrible 
I generally do n't give worry much about violence in films , or a vast amount of philosophy , symbolism or psychology All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature , a good setting of characters , a good direction This film could be voted for as a good film However , it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting br br First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film Not movie violence , I am talking about REAL violence This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women Not that we all do n't have some real twists with women \( respectively men \) But the conclusion of the film ruins it all br br spoiler Our heroine finally dies , \( by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me , now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch \) and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon , nature growing over her , in particular her sex Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine Women have to die , especially if men are attracted by their sexuality That seems to be the final conclusion end spoiler br br Well , well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself But to use big pictures , artsy directions cruelty to living creatures , just to say men can be frightened of women , and men are cruel to women Thats just not enough I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical , eastern and artistic and whatever approach But to me this film is just totally marred 
Average \( and surprisingly tame \) Fulci giallo which means it 's still quite bad by normal standards , but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance br br The genre 's well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue , wooden acting , illogical plot points And the finale goes on much too long , while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say limp affair br br Fulci 's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing , though Yellow clues wherever you look br br 3 out of 10 limping killers
The direction struck me as poor man 's Ingemar Bergman The inaudible dialogue was annoying The somber stoicism that all characters except Banderas' showed made me think they were drugged I think the director ruined it for me 
Despite the excellent cast , this is an unremarkable film , especially from the aviation perspective It may be somewhat better than the egregious von Richthofen and Brown but not by much Blue Max remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while Darling Lilli is fun if not taken seriously It 's interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new , high quality WW I aero film 
Winter Kills is a terrible , incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy thriller from little known director William Richert While watching the film , I honestly felt as if I was the emperor in the classic fable The Emperor 's New Clothes The film made me feel like a fool because I could n't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters But I felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots So I stuck with it to the end , hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself Then I realised the film is SUPPOSED to be serpentine , nonsensical and illogical , because that 's the whole point This is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists , with the knotting up of the plot used as a metaphor for the knotting up of truths , half truths and lies that define any conspiracy Even when I got that the joke was on me , I still felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie br br Young Nick Kegan \( Jeff Bridges \) is the younger brother of a former United States President who was assassinated in Philadelphia Nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the President and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun Nick follows the clues , but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances Also , his father Pa Kegan \( John Huston \) , a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman , keeps interfering with Nick 's investigation The deeper he delves into the assassination , the more Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings , where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted br br The film is an utter nightmare to follow , and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the afore mentioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history Elizabeth Taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue Richard Boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film 's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well , though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and , while they 're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs , they really belong in another film The film 's semi comic climax is farcical and disappointing , yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way There 's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for Winter Kills but I wo n't be counting myself among its number 
This was an awful movie ! Not for the subject matter , but for the delivery I went with my girlfriend at the time \( when the movie came out \) , expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression , with no uplift at the end The previews and ads made NO mention of this ! Plus , for all that they played up whoopi goldberg , my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes ! Again , the previews say nothing about this ! \( not that you would expect that , but it 's just more of the problem \) If I had known how depressing this movie would be , I would 've never have seen it Or at least , I would 've been prepared for it This was a bait and switch ad campaign , and I will NEVER see this movie again ! 
and it does n't help rohmer 's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject \( with a little help from Wagner \) br br maybe this movie did n't look so paltry when it came out , without the syberberg film to compare it to , which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources I actually ca n't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film all I know is , the German version is pure magic , while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes br br the music la musique is n't even credited here on IMDb but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th 14th centuries or something well it is n't a great help to the film it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy , comme le frommage mon cher ! ! ! br br rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive , too , and that does n't help matters syberberg 's Parsifal was adorable , and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented br br I shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater , the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty But even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer , I'm afraid br br points for earnestness , for chutzpah , but this film simply needed beau coup more bucks it does n't look like a medieval manuscript it looks CHEAPO ! BON MARCHE ! ! oh and yeah , it just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected blah ! 
Gods , I have n't watched a movie this awful in a long while Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr movies Yes , it is that astoundingly awful Mira Sorvino 's blank and wooden acting surely must 've been inspired by Freddie The movie staging was awkward \( like a play , rather , and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film \) The actors had no idea what they were doing , especially Sorvino Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs \? Nonsensical ! I had to turn the dvd player off , it would have been self inflicted pain to finish this film 
Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade I have n't seen it since I just watched the trailer though Does this look like a first grade movie to you \? I do n't think so I was so horrified by this movie , I could barely watch it It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half , and then there was the boy with ketchup ! I was freaked out by this film Now today , being 20 , I probably would not feel that way I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should n't see this movie , even though it 's PG Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids I do n't even remember what it was about , once was enough !

Not a very good movie but according to the info it 's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and that 's done effectively enough , with surprising frankness for the time Whatever technical flaws exist \( and there are plenty \) by watching this you 'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff again , nasty because it 's being done north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay br br I do n't think any of the Korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office , and if you watch the movies like this one and Pork Chop Hill in comparison to the Vietnam films I do n't know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the WWII concepts \( the boys tend to wisecrack a lot \) or the war or what , but it 's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like Go Tell The Spartans 
An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century It 's a string of several jokes acted out Some of them you could tell your Grandmother , some of them not , but it 's a fairly safe bet she 's heard them all before For what it tries to be , it 's not too bad Before you rent it , remember that it 's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation Robin Williams has a couple of bits , but he 's interchangeable with the other players 
This movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK , so i watched it The acting was TERRIBLE it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for Edward Furlong , terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago I 've watched it at least 20 times br br the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines br br on the plus side , it 's the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get , so that later you can tell other people how you could n't believe how terrible the movie was br br i think everybody should watch this , so that then we could appreciate better other , REAL , movies 
I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy Although the movie is family friendly , my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God If you obey God and follow Him , you are not guaranteed success Your football team wo n't always win You wo n't magically get better grades Infertility is n't always cured You wo n't always get a raise Sometimes , you 'll be stuck with the old car br br God does not exist to meet our every whim Rather , we were created to glorify Him Sometimes we glorify Him most when things seem to be going bad for us To live is Christ to die is gain

To start with , I have to point out the fact that you 're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour Yeah , some things happen , but you do n't know why or what for When you finally figure things out you just realize that it 's nothing but a twisted soad opera , dealing with mature prostitutes , dead mothers , illegitimate sons The characters are rather poor and the actors \( specially the young ones \) do n't help that much to make'em look credible Only Marisa Paredes stands out , but she 's a superb actress , no matter if the movie is pure rubbish br br The only positive things to say about Fr o Sol De Invierno is that d butant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions , and he 's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense Well , maybe the next time br br My rate 4 10

Just throw a little extra money into the make up ! Aside from the terrible script , this movie does have it 's moments , many of which are unintentionally funny It 's good for a laugh if you do n't have anything better to do , but just do n't spend any money on it Please 
I could n't watch more than 14 minutes of it It 's a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing The shots used are disgusting , they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time My head hurts try to watch that load of you know what Dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windows annoying What else it 's so badly framed all the time it 's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there I only directed short films , but I'm pretty sure I 'd be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable , just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it 's gonna be pretty awful So pretty much , try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost , it 'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental , and that 1h30 hour of your life you 'll never get back 
Wow Simply awful I was a fan of the original movie , and begrudgingly sat through part 2 , 3 was and improvement 4 , 5 and Freddy 's Dead were pretty bad But NOTHING is as bad as Freddy 's Nightmares Freddy acts as a Rod Serlingesq host of this anthology series br br I can accept how Freddy became one punchline after another , but at least in the movies the appeal of Freddy carried the movies , but here these were so poorly made , they looked like high school productions of a horror series The poor actors , if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for I'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors Ones just starting on the Hollywood ladder , brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week , or seasoned actors on their way down the Hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week br br I half expected Dana Plato to guest star , but she was already dead by the time this was in production br br To paraphrase Nancy 's line in the original Elm St , What ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this 
The thing that stands out in my mind in this film \( sadly \) is the introduction , where John Berlin \( Andy Garcia \) is driving into town You see his Mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with Redwood trees It 's quite beautiful br br As to Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin , well Andy is just too hispanic Latin for it to be passable Maybe a caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story \? Who knows But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks , he stands out like a sore thumb , especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry Yeah , I know , big deal right \? He 's still a good actor br br The title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims Jennifer All of the victims are blind and he dismembers them The killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness \( do n't ask \) appears , Helena Robertson \( Uma Thurman \) Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person , to my surprise When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt Freddy Ross I got worried Henriksen 's played in some pretty strange films , especially of late I still ca n't forget him in the bloodbath movie , Pumpkinhead br br Berlin movies into a small town from L A as a detective He begins investigating the Jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill His brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched So did the irony of SPOILER Freddy 's murder , with the recording and name similarities I got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight Jennifers And the motive of the killer as simply deranged did n't pack much of a punch In retrospect , this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons br br John Malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of Garcia ! Albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out As to the ending , it is a bit of a surprise , but is highly arguable , much like Sgt Ross' murder The killer chooses to walk after his running victim , opting instead to frolick I guess br br And there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it 's ridiculous I wo n't ruin the very end because despite it 's shakiness , it 's a good surprise Afterward though , you 'll probably say , as I did , boy was she lucky ! 4 10
I grew up \( b 1965 \) watching and loving the Thunderbirds All my mates at school watched We played Thunderbirds before school , during lunch and after school We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott No one wanted to be Alan Counting down from 5 became an art form I took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what I loved as a child How bitterly disappointing The only high point was the snappy theme tune Not that it could compare with the original score of the Thunderbirds Thankfully early Saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife created Jonatha Frakes should hand in his directors chair , his version was completely hopeless A waste of film Utter rubbish A CGI remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp sapiens was a huge error of judgment 
Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican They were not The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick \( with an obvious black daddy , cousins and auntie \) pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans , but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken , the food and music She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does Also , since she wants to dance around her African ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness \( i e Lackawanna Blues \) We can find a prideful Black Latina next time \( thank you Zoe Saldana , Gina Torres , Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa \) br br To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not black thank you We blacks certainly do not have anything in common with you so there is no love lost But , since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood , sweat and tears from the backs of the blacks you share nothing with br br If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media , but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations However , you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior you are not Also , you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood Try visiting Atlanta , Ga , Houston , Texas , Charlotte , N C Trust me none of those blacks want to claim your culture either 
This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie making It moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable , from the unrealistic to the ludicrous br br The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent Indians In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush In the British army , a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt , and if you get past that , he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable there are hundreds of them but they ca n't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers , of course not At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents , who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot , he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back The water boy bravely blows a bugle \( which comes from nowhere \) to sound the alarm this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys , and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do This scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy , they should have hired Keaton and done it better 
This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time , without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop , or even begin br br Try to fit this film into a genre and you wo n't , because it lacks a beginning , middle or ending I 've seen 'arty' movies before and this does n't even come close to being arty , abstract or original , it just seems to me to be completely pointless br br I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us That is if you can call it erotic It certainly did n't have taste 
So do n't even think about renting this from the shops , because this is one hell of a bad movie You 'd think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie Basically , a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out Fans of the completely terrible Shrek might enjoy , but Wallace Gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust Also , why did n't they do it in plasticine or clay \? I mean , CGI animation \? \? For an AARDMAN movie \? \? ! ! Obviously , Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing Wrong , wrong , WRONG ! ! ! Nearly every single character is awful , apart from that freaky frog guy , who is just right for a movie villain But everything else about the movie is DULL , DULL , DULL ! ! ! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie No , wait , actually , I DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie It 's just terrible But thankfully , it 's not as bad as Shrek 
Boring , badly written Italian exploitation flick Lots of nudity , gore and awful acting The werewolf makeup was the only thing that would raise a laugh Complete rubbish even for fans of cheesy Italian horror Please avoid 
Apart from Helen Bonham Carter , there is nothing worthy about this movie And the surprise ending \? ! The thought of a sequel is even more annoying Save your money , wait for the video and ignore that too 
OK now , lets see What was funny in the first movie \? I know , people with funny accents , people falling into the water , silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max , no good A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons , no good Boatcrash , check Funny comments between the two teams , they tried but failed Also , there are too may personalities they are following in this movie This film should be about what is happening on the water , not on land I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max No good All in all , I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts 
Dooohhh ! My Bwainn Hurrrts ! Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows br br Maybe it 's me ! ! Maybe I do n't get the premise of the film or maybe I do n't appreciate it 's alleged mystical atmosphere In my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds br br In addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a Tom Jerry cartoon Yaarrrghhh ! Why do I do it \? why do I watch such tripe \? It 's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion ! ! YAARGH ! ! An absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect Apart from that it 's not to bad 
This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever I am not a Shakespear fan , but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed Like I said though this one is quite boring It is in black and white , the pacing is slow , and there is minimal scenery The actors are all dubbed too so that does n't help This is the one MST 3000 I ca n't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep 
Except for the Brady Variety Hour , this was some of the hokiest television I 've seen in a while The video production qualities were n't too bad , but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80 's And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady and lost big time WAY too much eyeliner br br It was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid take part in this Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that would be opening 'in about a year ' br br As of this writing it is 17 years later and it has n't opened yet \( Unless you count Disney 's Animal Kingdom \) All in all though , for all the shortcomings , this still an interesting visual piece of Disney history 
Iberia is nice to see on TV But why see this in silver screen \? Lot of dance and music If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it 's better to see Bollywood movie They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience And time to time it 's look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big 
Misty Ayers had a smoking body , and that 's all this movie was about Pure exploitation flick I started playing a game with myself , counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes Case in point casually walking into a room and saying Hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic I 'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released What I learned from this movie that women 's low rise panties existed in 1954 I'm talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing \( except for bra and panties , sadly \) Also includes horrendous dubbing , leading to a Look out ! Godzirra ! effect 
Well i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it , and i wish i had , I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day , and it made me yearn for more of the same , what i got was AIRPLANE on CRACK i mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles , then you 'll probably be in heaven , but if your used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY , then you will be dissapointed , there was alot more Eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy , which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder , and part one 5 times as much Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 , but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well maybe its just me The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape , and then Rent it , dont buy it 
One note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge Department store clerk Betsy Drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage , pinning her hopes on women 's magazines until she spies super bait in the form of sleek bachelor Cary Grant The rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless Drake pursues her quarry I guess the word perky just about sum 's up Drake 's approach to the role She does have a charming smile , but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures , I began to overdose Grant 's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair There is one scene , however , that almost salvages this slender exercise Drake queries the hapless Grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies Here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable , and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes , the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day dream , circa 1948 
I 've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it So , after 15 minutes of watching I 've noticed that something is wrong with this movie it 's TERRIBLE ! I mean , in the trailers it looked scary and serious ! br br I think that Eli Roth \( Mr Director \) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid , the movie would be funny \( So stupid , it 's funny \? WRONG ! \) He should watch and learn from better horror comedies such as Fright Night , The Lost Boys and The Return Of the Living Dead ! Those are funny ! br br Cabin Fever is THE reason why I registered to www IMDb com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it br br I 've decided to watch the movie a second time AAARGH ! and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is Resident Evil \( horror \) or Dude , Where 's My Car \? \( comedy \) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy ! But this ! br br How bad can a script and a director be \? \? \? This bad Here are the awful scenes in chronological order br br In the early scenes we see Henry , who does n't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead glazed stare is dead ! br br The movie does n't explain anything about the blonde long haired kid who like to bite people br br And my answer to Marcy 's unanswered question \( What 's wrong with the woods \? \) is nothing The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense br br Then the smartest of the 5 pack , Bert , almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire He meets now infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the F word Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill Bert Do n't make me shoot you ! \( he forgets to add with my BB gun ! \) br br Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that \? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex , but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk ! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier \( A moment of clarity for a change \? \) Bert does n't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun br br Later , as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire , another weirdo shows up with his dog \( Maybe that 's what the warning about the woods is all about \? It 's filled with weirdos and their dogs ! \? \) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis \( Their brains are completely intoxicated ! No wonder why they are all so DUMB ! \) This is the last time we 'll see this forgettable character alive ! br br Henry shows up at their cabin , \( NOTE He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin ! ! ! \) looking worse , almost like a zombie , covered in goo ! He says he needs a doctor But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard , seats and windows The Fantastic Five come out running , armed with a BB Gun , a knife , a baseball bat \( huh \? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods \? \? \? \) , a poker , and a \( insecticide \? \) spray can , ready to combat the single , unarmed and terribly sick man \( clever script ! \) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun , which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth What else am I supposed to do \? Bert yells in his defense Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck 's windows instead Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say He 's coming towards us ! \( Thanks for the info , dumb broads , I can see that ! But I do n't think he wants to do you any harm ! \) Marcy sprays in his eyes , making Henry yelp ! And our hero Paul touches Henry 's arm with a burning log from the campfire , which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin ! \( Where has all that wisdom gone \? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll ! \) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away , screaming br br The following day , Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic And Marcy decides to go for help all by herself , in the woods , as Paul stays behind with Karen Does n't that sound idiotic \? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already going for help ! br br I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river ! How did she get a canoe \? Does she even know where she 's going ! \? Anyway , she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and , like in most horror movies , walks inside the cabin saying Hello \? Is anyone there \? Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her \( and me at first \) And along comes Jeff , as well How did THEY get here ! \? Did they swim across the river \? \? \? Do you see how brainless the script is ! \? br br Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin He somehow does n't notice the blood on their truck This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out \( Before I take my own eyes out ! Now , THAT 's funny ! \) br br If you liked this movie , do yourself a favor and watch Fright Night , The Lost Boys , or The Return of The Living Dead Then you 'll see they are MORE entertaining than this thing Even the Toxic Avenger part 2 , which is also a lousy film , is way MORE funnier than Cabin Fever 
There is n't much to say about this film , it is horrible br br The acting and dialog are way far away from even decent , the story of the hybrid werewolf 's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there br br CGI is something you would n't like to see It so amateurish that it makes me vomit br br The only good thing on the DVD was in the Extras The gag reel Everything else , just waste of time and money I hope noone will buy this , this is not even worth renting br br Just stay away of this 
The movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl , the other an upper class political party The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino , as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening br br If the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama , the performance of Al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man \( as The Godfather \) as here as a little servant \( see also Donnie Brasco \) br br Actually , the big young lion has become a tired old one This passing of ages is very moving , because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too br br But his slowness is only a make up because he can get back his energy in Church scene br br Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Al 's talent ! 
I find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM , American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers , Messiah of Evil has potential , but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it ca n't muster the film making prowess to pull it off br br The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back It does n't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror br br The surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon' , a scruffy and half mad alcoholic \( played by the great Elisha Cook Jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie \) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later , the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father 's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded , murderous , squirrel eating albino br br Part of the movie 's charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator , with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the 'intentional' , the 'unintentional' and the 'did n't really expect it to come out this way but it 's good enough WRAP SCENE' blur hopelessly br br Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled , feverish , stream of consciousness way , one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father , and the other narrated by her father 's voice as she reads his diary br br While we 're still talking about a 'living dead' picture , Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse , bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger' who came from the woods one day In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years \( you can hear the MST3K line already 'man is dead , only his capitalist food tins remain' \) and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater br br I generally think that the surreal works in careful , well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it 's not hidden within the perfectly normal \? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her , you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience , amused and satisfied with his own hijinks br br The general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark , the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either Add to that the choppy editing , average acting and Hyuck 's general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and I 'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it 's not particularly gory , trashy or sleazy 
This is a film that takes some digesting On the one hand , we are offered a tough outward shell , a story that does not only derive the Catholic Church , but does so foolishly , and uninformed On an inner layer , we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis , and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand br br At first glance , it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy If so , then Mr Durang needs to open a dictionary , because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word The jokes are pale the humor is awkward and poorly delivered In particular , Ms Keaton 's performance is flighty and over the top , well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridence , with her hi pitched voice and whining style All of this could be forgiven if it were n't for the last 20 minutes of this movie , that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981 br br Careful , spoilers ahead br br It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius \( Ignatius , by the way , is a male name , and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact , just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with \) When they all admit that they do n't live up to the church 's teachings , the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny , all too clich sepia tone flashbacks When one of them admits to having two abortions , the nun becomes even more abusive , until the pupil pulls out a gun After wrestling it away from her , the nun kills the pupil , presumably in self defense She then goes on a screaming rampage , killing a gay former student because of his sins The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christ like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her Can you say `heavy handed \? ' I knew you could ! br br I know there have been abusive nuns in the past , and I know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result , but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously , no pun intended This explanation is hard to swallow , though , simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another This film is simply anti Catholic tripe , which in the name of fairness and equality , is mean spirited and hateful br br This is a film I would recommend for a catholic , namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today If it were `Rabbi Ray explains it all' or `Imam Muhammad explains it all' , there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription But , sadly , because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority , it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view br br I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic , so it was n't just ignorance that brought them to make this film br br I give it 1 5 stars out of 5 , not because of its offensive nature , but because it was poorly written , poorly directed and just a bad movie in general Do n't even waste your time 
I have to say this is one of the worst films I 've ever seen They had a pretty good storyline to go on , but than the messed it up so badly First of all the cast is all wrong , where did that van peeble \( crap actor btw \) and puff daddy come from \? \? \? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood , and used to hang about with some real idiots This film does n't do Carlitos Way any justice Im so happy that the sequel Carlito 's Way came out first , if I had seen this rubbish first , I would have never given the pacino version a chance And anyway , pacino is supposed to have read this story , thought it 's crap and did the sequel instead Carlito 's Way Rise to Power 1 out of 10 Carlito 's Way 9 out of 10 
This movie is extremely boring , it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life Nothing exciting ever happens The director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life I had to watch other films by this director for a class , the others were not as boring This film was also watched for an assignment it better be worth the boringness with a good grade ! ! Overall , unless it 's required , do n't watch the film But do n't discount other films by this director , because they 're not as bad and do n't discount other films about Africa , they 're usually good , especially when done by a western director 
Jeremy Northam struggles against a Total Recall clone script and disposable romantic by play to bring life to a confused character Lucy Liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman like finish You ca n't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term Femme fatal and Romance French film noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together br br This movie fails , not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists Little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period Automobiles are very 1990 's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques br br The technology is positively hilarious Massive 2001 A Space Odyssey mainframes fed by man portable CD ROM 's with data collected for some unexplained reason , in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un savvy technologist today would obviously be aware There is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open source nature of the cyber community , research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time br br DVD interviews also reveal the original movie name was Company Man but this likely ditched in order to cash in on Matrix hype The Cypher title has only the slightest link with the movie Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept and completely re written the Decalogue br br This is Tele movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production It might have made a good sub plot for Alias 
This movie was terrible The plot sucked , the acting was bad , the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back The balloon scene was stupid , the Mormon jokes are really old , the soundtrack sucked , I saw no chemistry between the two leads , it 's full of stereotypes , stupid local celeb cameo 's most noted was Del I'm going to drive as fast as I want to computer idiot What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up This movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs into Hollywood I E The RM , Church ball , etc etc I would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show 
The first five minutes of this movie showed potential After that , it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy The best part is that I could n't stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern I would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed 22 million in the box office and only cost about 1 5 million to make Congrats to Lion 's Gate for being able to pull that one off 
Buck 's role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker \( of The Price is right \) running a country the same way he runs his show But there 's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey Kurt Thomas as the baby faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills , but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever There 's a few spooky moments \( in the Village of Crazies , mostly \) , and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences But any given Ninja movie will give you much more entertainment , and you wo n't feel as guilty about laughing 
When I read the back of the DVD case , I thought that it sounded really interesting so I had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the 4 for 20 dollars section at Blockbuster When we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it , we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks Let 's put in something else I 'll admit , a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit But come ON , at least get some decent actors ! Every once in a while in a movie , if the acting is bad and the movie is n't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting , I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they 're over \( or under \) doing their lines But I can only take so much Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter , there was no delivery for their lines amateur does n't even come close to the acting in this film br br Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie It 's the most pointless thing I 've ever had the displeasure of watching DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! 
I had to endure teen aged , high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show I really do not care about high school girls fretting about their relationships I 've spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I care nothing about fictional teenies going through lite versions of the horrors I endured I want science fiction That 's the only reason I'm here There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show We FINALLY see a proto Cylon It was good but with one problem Its red eye dot would lock onto an object of interest We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth , giving the machine a map of the world The red eye dot does not ever stop moving back and forth br br I really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode 
The movie had a cute opening , I truly believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies i 've seen in a while there was something particular foreign about the way the movie was set up , realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical But then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be an understatement The most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every 'likable' character A scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the woman of his dreams only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on lookers Come on In the end , the 'good guys' win , 'bad guys' loose You get the picture A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie 
This movie was absolutly awful I ca n't think of one thing good about it The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed , and that is saying alot ! ! ! And dialogue , What dialogue \? \? \? To think that I was a fan of the first one \( I use that comment loosely , its more like a guilty pleasure , than anything else \) This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud ! ! ! ! Nothing good can come of this movie What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you ca n't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of ! ! ! This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time 2 10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1 
So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie , there was just very little excitement The acting was atrocious , to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes \( the church lady for example \) The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin , although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like The Ring Rather then get the police involved which I'm sure those earplugs she found would have DNA all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister I call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too , which the movie then fades to black Bad dialog , bad acting , bad ending 
This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest I'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it 's the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do Thank God , Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent He is a good character actor but that 's about it Klaus is so much better His performance is muted and noteworthy 
 but this just is n't working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good On what grounds \? There are some loose hints here and there , but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing Lynch 's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet , are very playful when doing that There is some visual sense , there are some subplots , characters , ideas etc But this is dull and yes , pointless Because whatever there is to explore is either to small , either too far fetched , or simply told before in a superior manner It 's just Lynch exploring DV , nothing more so it should be treated like this 1 10
Creep Your journey terminates here Some very graphic scenes and well , yeah , that 's about all for this film br br No real plot , no storyline No likable characters , well , 'characters' is n't correct considering you do n't have a clue who anyone really is I mean , they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers \( who is this thing \? why is he there \? \) , that 's quite scary I guess , but do I really care \? No , I do n't Why do n't I \? Because I do n't have a clue who these people are and I do n't know if I should want them to live or die It 's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you , which it rarely does br br This film lacks any meaning , any purpose It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up It jumps right into the action Basically , some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground , get chased by a weird creature , then they eventually escape from it br br Creep has its moments which make you jump , the art is good , the location is excellent and the sounds are OK , but that is n't what makes a decent horror film , so unfortunately all that goes to waste br br It 's nothing new Another predictable modern 'horror' , where Kate \( the lead 'character' \) consistently does the stupid hey , I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation , but , oooh no ! I'm going to do the total opposite because I'm a dumb blond thing I wish they would n't do that , it 's done so many times , it 's boring and gets predictable In fact , I'm pretty annoyed the silly woman did n't get stabbed by the , erm , grey alien looking creature br br Your journey terminates here is the films tag line Well , Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film If you 've had a few beers , got a couple of mates back at yours , then sure , watch it by all means But if you want something original and clever , avoid 
I watched DVD 1 only The program proper may have 10 minutes of good information otherwise it 's snotty putdowns of religious people It 's as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm , and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition br br Also , Flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues , and they take over the movie It never gets back on topic br br Religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings Arguments from such victimized people seem irrational , and therefore unconvincing br br Anti religious people will want more data We do n't need to be told that religious people are nutty , any more than American Jews need to be told how annoying Christmas music gets by mid December br br In the best scene , the Superintendent of Fleming 's childhood Christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations That seems like the most honest part of the movie , and it was too short br br If Fleming were a bit more self aware , he might have a good story in him about his own \( past current \) relationship to Christianity , and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth br br And perhaps he could lend his Christ never walked the earth material to a more serious documentarian I'm not studying the writings of Saul Paul to find out how air tight this all is , but a quick browse of Wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited br br The bonus interviews are pretty good , tho they do n't bolster Fleming 's thesis much Sam Harris is a good spokesperson for the anti religious POV , and he does n't go light on those other , non Christian religions Harris also has some good \( and easily Google 'd \) interviews on Salon com , Amazon com , and Samharris org 
This film was the worst film I have ever viewed It was like a homework assignment for a film class It totally misses the mark when it comes to the message it is TRYING to relay Characters are over exaggerated , poor acting and as for a plot well it is utterly ridiculous The cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film , the co actor is handsome and that 's about it Moral of this movie NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER ! Save your time , money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than I It was painful to watch and quite frankly I am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it ! 
First of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note A 10 year old girl , playing around in a moving vehicle , decides it would be funny to cover up her mom 's eyes with her hands , and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom duh I am sorry , there is positively no 10 year old that dumb The rest of the movie does not get much better After the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10 year old on the planet , the dad moves the family to Genova , Italy , where he is to teach at a local university , but here is the clincher he does not speak a word of Italian ! Then the little girl has visions of mommy \( who she killed \) , and often subsequent night terrors which always , always end by the father holding and coddling her Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found \( followed by of course more hugging and crying \) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid , ignorant people off the planet Do not get me wrong , because I love indies , but an indie about dumb people \( and I mean really dumb \) is simply ridiculous and pointless It is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios , because the locale was interesting 
I originally gave this episode a rating of two I now wish I 'd thought more about it I also wish they had negative rating options br br Watching it , I was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish I adore Ron Pearlman , and John Carpenter so what went wrong \? \? Last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue I think that this season Mr Carpenter managed to make something so grey area that you ca n't immediately see if he is pro choice or anti abortion It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized he is very much anti abortion you get this most clearly in the end when the 'Mother' shoots the baby and kills it , to the dismay of the 'Father' , who walks off in grief , leaving the mother unharmed But you also see it in the way the Ron P character is treated I hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police Instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him \( only to pay for it in the end \) I do n't mind someone having a strong view on something , even if it is n't something I agree in , but I do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view , rather than trying to look like they 're sitting somewhere in the middle br br But , political issues aside , this episode was beyond poor The music was retro 70 's and just plain did n't work The acting \( other than Ron P \) was poor The effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had br br All this being said , I'm glad they have the Masters of Horror I do n't mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones Its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while I do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from Masters some of these people just plain do n't deserve the title \( Let me stress tho even tho I hated this episode , John Carpenter TOTALLY deserves the title He is a master thru and thru \) 
This movie was packed pull of endless surprises ! Just when you thought it could n't get worse , they added more joints and more pink fuzzy lined vans with raunchy sex scenes As you can guess , I was a victim of the original version We were tricked into watching it thinking it was Supervan , the host box which promised lasars , jail breaks , and much more Who would have thought a Dollar Store Christmas present could have been so much fun ! 
Honestly I am not even joking when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! This film dose n't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line I can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from The Omen and other movies like it For example the nanny Lucy in this film is actually one of the devil 's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan does this sound a lot like Mrs Baylock to anyone else Another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted , just like in The Omen However luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body yet another coincidence \? \? \? \? \? \? And to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls , much like the priest in The Omen having pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wall paper Please do n't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and The Omen for you because as I 've stated above there are far too many to mention here 
OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH does his second half and wait br br He makes a 3 30 hours film which loses on patience , time etc The viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this film br br OK they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why \? 6 stories \? br br We have the Anil Juhi story convincing but boring do n't TV serials show such stories \? br br We have Govinda Shannon story which is funny and works well br br We have Akshaye Ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy br br We have Salman Priyanka story which is the worst , not just acting terms , it makes no sense at all br br We have Sohail Isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories br br We have John Vidya story a good story in all respects br br But then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy The climax is n't appealing though especially The climax of Salman Priyanka story Nikhil Advani 's handling is alright at places , some stories are well handled but weak at places Music \( SEL \) is good , but too many songs Cinematography is nice , every story is given a different look , texture and it works br br Actors Govinda rocks , after a dismissal comeback with BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well , though he looks out of shape and tired John excels in his part , Akshaye Khanna overacts for a change br br Sohail Khan is too over the top and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal br br Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked \? br br Salman Khan does n't act only , just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her , she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good , Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
This is one of those movies that 's trying to be moody and tense , and instead , ends up tripping all over itself Having seen it at a queer film festival , I was intrigued by the young college threesome gone wrong write up , however , over all ended up quite disappointed br br It 's hard to critique a true story since there 's not much that can be done about the plot but I found this disjointed , melodramatic and wholly depressing It 's dark and almost sinister , painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close ups It just does n't work some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe , my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes br br The story has an interesting premise , but this just spins downward into a dark , miserable spiral 
A really bad sequel Part 1 had a lot of funny moments part 2 is just bad \( in a boring way \) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans br br Shame on you , Otto Waalkes ! br br The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently seems to be pis ed about the other characters It 's quite easy to identify with him br br The screenplay is sloppy non existent The director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately The acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play br br Technically the movie is awful as well , but who can blame the cinematographer sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director \? 
I remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid , and there were parts of it \( many in fact \) that I did not understand I think I have seen it once as an adult , and I then understood those parts The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all So what kind of movie is this \? Is it a kids movie \? Not hardly It contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children \? Maybe , but then why would n't it focus more on John Ritter 's character instead of Junior \? When a film has a 7 year old as its main character , in order to do well with it 's audience , it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd , otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate \( even 8 year olds would n't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them \) I'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office , and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market 
I remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it I guess I was a bit too old to get all excited and I was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy br br In the early 90 's we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 Ninjas I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone br br Many kids movies have some big point they 're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message , this one does n't have any message at all it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes br br The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to \? The acting is pretty bad Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here The short , fat , gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious The kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was maybe the worst kid actor I have ever seen br br The movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review 3 ninjas yea you know they 're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously Need I say more Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone br br With all that said KIDS WILL LOVE IT This movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it If you do n't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see If you do n't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts , real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids I say kids because I think even the girls will like it I recall all the girls having a crush on Rocky br br 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults this movie failed big time at that It is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and I would not allow a child of mine to watch it Kung Fu the TV series is on DVD and there 's tons of great Shaw Brothers films out there Why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way , perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 Ninjas no no no never kick a man between the legs never thats so unninja like 
Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher , and the light fades quickly If not her , than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition Problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting , and the group are short a few people Then , a killer is on the loose I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one It had a fair set up , or maybe that was just Daphne Zuniga in it The film is too slow , and almost as silent as a library Most of the acting is below average , and the point of view moments are so old news Acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as Hellraiser and Entrapment scored this , in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie Still , it seems higher than the movie deserves So , other than Young and Zuniga , this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel 
 \( A possible spoiler or two \) br br Soul Survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever Nothing makes sense at all , there 's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead The entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that do n't really tie together , by the end of the film br br Tha acting is non existent , the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing , it just makes the movie even harder to watch br br I kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came Definitely the worst film of the year 1 2 stars 
I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I did n't This movie has a VERY hard time following and or staying to a plot If someone tells you it 's a comedy , do n't be fooled , it 's about 98 percent odd drama and 2 comedy All actors turn in a great performance , that cannot be denied , however it seems like it really lost something somewhere Do n't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what This had potential , and instead it was really a flop I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back , but the video rental place does n't do returns on time Save your money and see something else 
Angela Johnson \( Pamela Springsteen yes she 's related to Bruce \) , the killer from the first film , is up to her old tricks again She 's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex , drugs and swearing things are fine But a few step over the line and Angela kills them cracking bad jokes all the way br br The original Sleepaway Camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula There are plenty of gory killings in here \( people are burnt alive , heads are cut off , throats slashed \) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical This also has the smallest amount of campers I 've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles \( especially Higgins \) As expected there 's the gratuitous female nudity \( here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman \) and the obligatory good girl good boy team \( Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins \) With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy even by slasher movie standards There 's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse ! Boring and sick with a stupid plot , pointless nudity and bad gore Skip it 
I read the comment of Chris m grant from United States br br He wrote A Fantastic documentary of 1924 This early 20th century geography of today 's Iraq was powerful br br I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran , the Zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie Grass , A Nation 's battle for life These traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures I am from this region of Iran myself I am a Bakhtiari br br Chris , I am sorry to bother you but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Irak as you mentioned in your comment Iran and Irak are two different and distinct countries Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for an Mexican Thanks , br br Ziba
What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is \( and most US wars recently made only to get some oil \) br br How many innocent civilian casualties there has been , how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are br br So , let me ask you if American soldier kills women and children apart from enemy , its OK , but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well , it is not \? Your logic fails , gentleman br br I 'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else , 3 in total 
How cynical are the writers , to pander so I may be an American citizen , but I do n't need to see other Americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film I'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic , sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in U 571 \( which changes British submariners to American ones \) but you still walk away feeling a little slimy Really , the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes ! How sad , unnecessary ! I 'd just like to say to the writers it 's obvious to many of us that you ca n't capture real people , with real problems , under real pressure , and that you 've taken some very well tested shortcuts Lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar coated tripe 
Honestly , I was disappointed in Expiration Date Super clever title and interesting premise , but I do n't think it delivered What was it about \? The main character 's desire to reconnect with his Native roots \? Or , more likely , it was his need to overcome his fear of death But , he was n't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear it seems as if his life was going fine , but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying I did n't buy it Meanwhile , the supporting characters in the film did n't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story They were all just doing their thing , running parallel to the main character Also , what was treated as a curse looked more like a coincidence Who cursed the family \? Why \? When \? Finally , why did n't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday \? Those are my criticisms , but I did love the shots of Seattle , cinematography was beautiful , acting was good in the times it was n't outstanding 
Deceptive Advertising I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way Rise to Power that states From the Producer of Scarface and Carlito 's Way LETS GET IT STRAIGHT Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface , in fact he was 'editing room assistant' for Scarface Not to take away from Bergman 's talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class I think I can speak for the masses when I say We hate being blatantly lied to As far as the movie goes , It was poor at best I did think Puff Daddy did a good job Although , Luis Guzman should be ashamed for working on this film Overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for Carlito 's Way It 's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film 
This movie is horrible ! It rivals Ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments I would have rated it lower than a 3 , save for a couple of funny lines but , overall , this film was crap ! It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the directing sidelines forever ! 
This is one of those awful , sex driven B movies that could n't have played anywhere near a theater Women run around dressed in scantily clad bunny outfits , an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes , and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man , who has an oddball son \( Jim Hanks , who is of course Tom 's brother \) , whom the man wants to get laid Hanks is actually sort of good , but this movie goes nowhere and has no point One must wonder why it was even made \? Nevertheless , because of Hank 's performance and a few entertaining moments \( but no more than a few \) , it received a stellar 2 out of 10 I think I was being nice , though 
I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great , or I would n't have bothered to see it the other day I like supporting indie cinema , especially if they are gay themed , but this movie is almost too much to tolerate Those that walked out , as I considered doing after about three minutes , probably did n't mind shelling out 11 00 , or just figured it was going nowhere , fast , and not going to improve Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they did n't pay to get in in the first place br br Logan is bored He 's a klutz He 's gay I'm okay with that The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also ! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry , re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene , and the second scene , etc , etc Nothing or no one goes anywhere NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting Probably most appalling of all is that I did n't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan That in itself is a major accomplishment He did n't grow , he did n't change , he did n't learn \( there is no one to teach him anything \) , he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING , and neither did the movie ! Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make br br Additionally , the title makes no sense at all 1 10

For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion Someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world`s oceans are awash with giant Squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don`t have the budget to pull it off doesn`t stop them NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like Oh my gawd it`s heading this way and Run for your lives then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget Unfortunately NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been upped to include better actors The cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them \? br br And the last word on this being a TWISTER clone Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER
Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful I was n't going to comment , but the film just bugs me so much , and the writer director in particular So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers br br I saw the original Wicker Man and really loved the cornucopia of music , sensuality , paganism in a modern world , and the clash of theological beliefs This said , I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies should n't be done For example , I liked the original 1950 's Invasion of the Body Snatchers , but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake Both films can stand on their own Another example is The Thing The original , as campy as it looks compared to today 's standards , has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell \( my all time favorite horror movie \) So that small minority of people who like The Wicker Man re make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it 's a re make br br This film solidified for me Neil LaBute 's sexism and misogynistic tendencies It also made me wonder how executives , wanting to make a serious thriller , would green light a product that is so anti female There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he 's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects are n't forthcoming \? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion The threat to the main character came from everyone , male and female There was no sexual hierarchy br br The metaphor of bees , drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient \( The drone must die ! \) , especially when Cage 's character has bee allergies I kept wondering why the men on the island did n't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts These were not women with special supernatural powers , and half of them seemed to be pregnant , the other half old and fat , and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs , so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women Physically dominate them There did n't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy But if they were content being drones , why make them unable to speak \? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated \( That movie was made already The Stepford Wives anyone \? \) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh t together and were truly equal citizens br br The problem with the man hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out I belief LaBute should 've left the society an egalitarian one , kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness , and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around \? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused , thus , an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children LaBute has said he created the fianc and daughter story thread to give Cage 's character an incentive to search I do n't think you need that Any child abused will make an adult react to save them The irony of course would be that the child Cage saves ultimately brings him death br br The dialogue was contrived and campy The whole third act was hilarious The audience I saw it with guffawed \( and later booed at the end \) I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is We do n't need that Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child Most of us in America have seen Law Order and other cop procedurals We come into the movie as if we are Cage 's partner solving a mystery br br So much potential wasted Neil LaBute , stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst ridden plays and flicks of that sort Stay with your own company of men Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers Here is your jar of honey I 'll watch that 
Spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone br br This movie really annoyed me It has a great looking monster , has some good low budget effects , some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad Half way in I started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the DVD br br The problems with this movie are many First off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school You do n't believe anything from the get go as a result The scarecrow , while looking great is n't much beyond that He says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary Is this a comedy or a horror movie \? Its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up It seems more send up of every clich than heartfelt horror film I some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind , horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it br br Despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid Even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks , you 're paying too much br br Avoid 
This is the worst imaginable crap The novel by H Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic The makers of this worthless movie do n't follow it closely Well , old novels are n't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one 's own If all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered down clich s one should stick to the original If they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard BUt there 's no imagination at all only tiredness This should be bought or watched only by collectors of Victorian novels made into movies br br Just a hint , and not a spoiler I think , to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on TV or God forbid waste money on buying this Gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to Gollum has been turned into a nice gal ! 
If one sits down to watch Unhinged , it is probably because its advertisements , video boxes , whatever , scream that it was banned in the UK for over 20 years \( as virtually every video nasty does \) It 's true exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy Being an exploitation fan , however , none of this was new to me The advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the UK do n't necessarily make me want to watch it in fact , the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid British censors are How I came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only 6 99 The price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next Halloween , but a cheap padding of your DVD collection never hurts I did force myself , however , to watch it all in one sitting , because I find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it So anyway , after 90 minutes of Unhinged , I found that I had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence I think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique br br The layout of Unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s There 's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore That 's about it Anyway , it starts with a group of three attractive co eds crashing their car on the way to a concert Though two of them \( Terry and Nancy \) are okay , one \( Gloria \) is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie They are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion \( that happens to have no phone , of course \) with rather strange occupants Marion is a middle aged woman with a man hating mother who constantly accuses Marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them \( echoes of Psycho \? \) She also happens to have a crazy brother Carl who lives in the woods , because her mother 's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house After hanging with Marion for awhile , Terry \( our hero \) and Nancy decide they must contact their parents Despite everyone 's warnings , Nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone \( her fate is not hard to predict \) After that , we see Gloria again , who is then promptly butchered with an ax When Terry discovers that Gloria has disappeared from her room , she decides something is n't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends That may be easier said than done , however , with crazy Carl lurking around br br After viewing Unhinged , I read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that Unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end Normally , I do not drag other people 's opinions into my reviews \( especially when they contradict my views \) , but in this case , I was so puzzled by their reactions that I thought it would be relevant to mention This is because in actuality , the film crawls Normally for the slow building tactic to work , the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger Oh sure , we see two of them get murdered , but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom We are aware that there 's a killer on the loose , but this is only focused on three times in the film that means there 's no reason to fear for the victims Instead , the film 's events are explained not by the actions of the characters , but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking If there 's one thing I can assure you from watching this , it 's that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious None of this is helped by the atrocious acting It seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience br br Of course , I 'd be a liar if I said there was n't one part of the movie that I enjoyed Specifically , the ending was one of the best I 've ever seen in a slasher film you just do not expect that to happen Just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular Ah , I wo n't spoil it for you , nor will I say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow moving film , but it definitely will get your attention Other than that , the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material , but it 's not like you could n't tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film Anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed , however those are the only scenes of gore present That and , of course , no one scene can save an entire movie I normally preach the doctrine that as long as there 's action , the worse a movie is , the better it gets Unhinged only grasps one part of this concept The whole film just feels Luke warm there 's potential alright , but the director either was n't experienced enough to make it work or just did n't know what the hell he was doing 
Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial , we tend to lose interest really fast br br I found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule ! And guess what , they really would like to be doing something else \( the viewer has similar feelings \) br br Surprisingly , when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film , I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging br br I just do n't usually watch that much late night TV , so I ca n't recommend this film , unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life 
Even thought I'm not the biggest of Cher fans , this movie was her crowning achievement Granted , there were long term side effects and risks of brain damage , memory loss \( and \) intellectual impairment , upon the screening such a film A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds br br Cher plays someone very un Cher in this movie , a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family They 're anti American , pro Italian and always at each other in someway She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while , a nice mamma 's boy man , and he asks her to marry him She says yes I loved her mom 's questions Do you love him Loretta \? , No , Good If you love him he 'll drive you crazy because they know they can But you like him then \? , Oh yeah , he 's a sweet man Ma When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother , he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he 's been estranged from for years br br This victory for human rights carries even greater significance , as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment In 1938 , Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti , saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs , easing the job of slitting their throats Cerletti was inspired , and began experimenting with electroshock on humans , developing the first Electroshock machine Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern br br This was , in so many ways , an anti American movie It 's about love , to be sure , but it 's also about infidelity , secrets , lonely people , and strange behavior brought on by American policies The characters , from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant , the aunt and uncle , her parents and their problems , the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters It 's somewhat of a chick flick , as it 's how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp It 's a Cinderella story in many ways , and that is every little girl 's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan br br Assuming free and fully informed Consent , it is well to reaffirm the individual 's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses But we might ask ourselves whether we , as fans of cinema , though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath , should be offering it 
It was the Sixties , and anyone with long hair and a hip , distant attitude could get money to make a movie That 's how Michael Sarne , director of this colossal flop , was able to get the job Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie In fact , the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60 's hip black and white featurette called Joanna That film starred the similarly talentless actress waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat like twitter Sarne , who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon , never mind a big budget Hollywood film , was in way over his head David Giler 's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era , Myra Breckinridge provides that marker It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea change in the body politic Breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein Watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years br br Many reviewers have spoken about the inter cutting of footage from other films , especially older ones Some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie , others found them senseless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement br br In my opinion , the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed That is to say , Sarne was so imagination challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time They were n't inspiration , they were desperation His writing skills were nonexistent , and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie , and he could n't It was beyond his slim capabilities Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips The ghosts of writers and directors many long since passed on were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck was n't able to This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew \( not to mention the producers and the accountants \) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit , to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus Um , oops No Zeus no imagination no sparks millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips flying out the window Bye bye br br As for myself , I hated the film clips They denigrated Sarne 's many betters , poked fun at people whose talents even those whose skills were not great far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality and even of plain competency compared to even the cheesiest of them 
A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red Undertow is pointless and unengaging , and made me think often of a phrase by Twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together When someone brings up the category of Worst Films Ever Made , it 's not the likes of Plan 9 or Attack of the Killer Shrews that I think of it 's the likes of this What a complete waste of time my own and everyone who was involved with this flick 
I see that someone already thought of a similar analogy , which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie They said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot Besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child porn \( which I feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically , I would liken this movie to a recipe that 's been torn in half It 's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients , with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product From the start , character development and story development are lacking unfortunately , many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think Ahh OK finally we are going to find out something more about WHY this scene is going on or WHO this character is or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more or understand and get involved more with this inter character relationship etc But no such luck ! On the contrary , many times I was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled , only to find that whatever mini plot within whatever mini plot \( and that poorly presented \) was just a ruse Why I stayed with it till the end is a mystery , other than usually IFC has better selections and they gave it 2 1 2 stars \( another mystery \) It 's not that the characters are n't likable to SOME degree , or that you ca n't identify with them or their humanness at all it 's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort I notice this was shot around Santa Cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone 's film school project I wish I could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half 
Skip Mission Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead The network took parts 1 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode Although Galactica suffered from network controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series Fire in Space , on its own , is one of the worst episodes As a historical note , watch Galactica , the original Star Trek , and then the revival Trek series , and you 'll see the difference in quality between network produced sci fi and syndicated sci fi 
Whoever wrote up Redline as a great car movie must be getting paid off by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming , steaming pile of amateur crap Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane br br Take every cheesy clich out of an 80s action TV series , put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business br br This is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap

I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet It 's just too damn good Was Batman Beyond good \? Yeah , but it was no TAS Is Justice League good \? It 's not too bad , but it 's no TAS br br The Batman is certainly no TAS , either , but I wo n't hold that against it It would be unfair and besides , it has plenty of other problems with it br br The concept of a younger , less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one , and at times the art is very nice But all of the rest of the time , the art is worthless Americanime , and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself It is paced , written , and designed like an Americanime If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures , I 'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect The Joker is a homicidal , mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits , unpredictability , and clever gadgets to fight Batman When he is forced to fight hand to hand , he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air , accompanied by speed lines If they had wanted to do that with a villain , there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely And it 's not that re imaginings are a bad thing , do n't get me wrong TAS \( there I go again \) took Mr Freeze from your standard icegun wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character Of course Freeze was n't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade , but the point stands What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large , smelly dump on them Guess what \? They were eating corn br br It 's obvious this show ca n't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still does n't work for me The plots are n't good and they do n't develop any better They 've been written for the demographic of children under twelve Should children be able to enjoy a show \? Of course they should This should n't be an adult show with swearing , nudity , and gratuitous violence But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages This show misses that mark br br Is this show a TAS \? No , of course not The problem is it 's not even a JLU 
I dislike this movie a lot If you 've read the Puzo 's books , or at least have watched very closely the two first movies \( specially the first one \) , you 're going to agree with me br br Compared with the Corleone 's saga presented by Puzo 's novel , the script of this film is , sometimes , even ridiculous The characters and the relationships among them are distorted The story ends up reaching nowhere , although it appears to go to some direction during the movie br br It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone 's saga in the 90 's , and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before But , in the other hand , I do n't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies , in contexts when they did n't fit Why this \? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film 's qualities br br What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo , Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies So does Al Pacino , for being the actor he is But Mario Puzo should n't have written this How come \? He damaged all his previous work What a shame , my friend The Puzo 's novel The Last Don is a 90 's story about the mob , and it is great We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III 
For a made for TV horror movie the movie started off very interesting I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film But the ending was a total dissappointment The movie was going along fast paced and was building up to , it seemed like anyway , to a very climatic end But guess what there is no end The movie is just over and after almost one and a half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened Why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered There was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot This film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it Very dissappointed This film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film A real BOMB ! 
REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES \( 2 outta 5 stars \) No , this is not a long lost ancestor to the classic George A Romero zombie flicks This is a low budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time but seems awfully routine these days There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers and a close up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure it had audiences gasping The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail 's pace so it seems feature length , believe me ! There really is n't much to recommend it you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star wading through a swamp The ending is interesting so I 'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 DVD compilation at Wal Mart for five bucks Hey , it 's well worth the money 
Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all It does n't deserve the name American Pie They should have stopped at The Wedding br br This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series It does n't fell like American Pie at all It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies br br I do n't recommend it ever Actually i do n't recommend any of the American Pie Presents movies Just stick with the nice original trilogy br br 2 10
save your money i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible , the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80 's this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it 
Alan \( Anthony Steffen \) , an English multi millionaire with a few screws loose \( thanks to his first wife 's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth \) , entices sexy , red headed women to his castle , offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend Once back at his ancestral pile , he gets them nekkid , proceeds to flog them with a bull whip , and then kills them br br But when he meets blonde hottie Gladys \( Marina Malfatti \) and falls for her ample charms , he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married Their wedded bliss is short lived , however , thanks to Alan 's iffy mental state , which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds br br So let 's recap a groovy 70s Euro horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods several vicious murders \( including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes \) Normally , a checklist like that would guarantee me a good time so why did I find 'The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave' so dull \? Well , for starters , the plot is way too convoluted there are red herrings , crazy plot developments , and suspects galore , and it all becomes a bit too much By the ridiculous ending in which we discover that , all along , several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on Alan 's wealth , and that our red head killing nut job is actually supposed to be the hero of the movie my head was hurting too much to care ! Secondly , Emilio Maraglia 's direction is pretty torpid Stylish , yes but as slow as molasses at times br br And then there 's the bits that are just too damn silly , possibly even for a giallo the death by poisonous snake bite \( surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever \) Alan 's Aunt Agatha , an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in England \( mentioning 'pounds' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough \) and then , of course , there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool br br 'The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave' is n't a total waste of time \( how could it be , with so much female flesh on show \? \) , but there are much better giallo 's out there Watch this one if you 're a fan of the genre and you 've already seen the best but do n't expect too much 
I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen the others being THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST All three movies are about death If you LIKE being thoroughly depressed , then by all means watch this film or any of the others In this film , the acting is good and some of the scenery \( apart when people are dying \) is lovely But , I am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in ! Despite a happily ever after ending , the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another And , for some crazy reason , I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie \( I know this sounds crazy folks after all , is n't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway \? \) br br For a more uplifting viewing experience , try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE , George C Scott 's Christmas CAROL or A Christmas STORY instead unless of course you like being miserable 
Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads , this movie is really , really bad The cheap production values do n't help Of course , you would n't really notice that the production values are cheap if they did n't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with Even for a B movie genre freak like myself , this movie really sucks 
Where can I begin I heard this movie was coming out and I was very mad I am a huge fan of the original Carlito 's Way and when I heard about this , I thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in Hollywood I thought it would be bad Boy was I wrong , this movie was much worse than I expected Not saying all sequels are bad , but thats the problem with Hollywood these days , they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them This was not a theater release , it is a DVD release Still , in my opinion , there was no reason at all for this to be made After I heard about this film was in progress , I then later heard Pacino was not in it That right away killed any chance this movie had of being good Why did I check this movie out then some of you may ask \? Well I had the opportunity to see it so I did I do n't only watch movies that I have high expectations of , I had low expectations on this one obviously I just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it Now , if any of you reading this are a Carlito 's Way fan , you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail br br VERY MINOR SPOILER I wont ruin anything , because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash All I will say is in the end of Carlito 's Way 2 , we do n't see Carlito go to jail Now , I do n't know about any of you , but I would have thought a prequel to Carlitos Way would show how he ended up in jail I even had some interest in actually seeing what happened br br Now , thats not my only problem with the film The actor who played Carlito did not do too bad a job , but he could not have saved this film if he tried There 's not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that Carlito 's Way fans would like You do n't see any appearance of Kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one , I would have liked to see something like that What is even worse , is Luis Guzman is in this film , yet he does n't play the same character he plays in the first film Big mistake on their part , why cast the same actor for a different character , it made the movie worse than it already was br br Bottom line , I am a Carlito 's Way fan , this new straight to DVD release is a disgrace If you are a fan , do n't watch this movie coming in with high expectations This movie did basically nothing for me , and it is definitely one movie I wont be picking up on DVD , or watching ever again 
Invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the so bad it 's good category if the film was n't quite so sexist or racist That it is such just makes it plain bad br br It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space , and the kind of racist stereotypes \( in this instance , Native Americans \) that you would normally find in thirties forties b westerns In terms of being non funny , the same walking through the cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie Ray does do one good impression of Jimmy Cagney \( but ca n't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row , nor handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it \) There really are n't any production values to speak of , as the Star Creatures make the Ro Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic br br This film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all night drive in br br 
Be warned Neither Zeta Jones nor McGregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe Their roles are in fact minor br br The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama , with neither being really engaging Especially I find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist , not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc The plot drags terribly , and I turned this one off after about 2 3 unusual for me , as I like to finish what I start The good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars br br 2 10
 \( Spoilers \) br br I was very curious to see this film , after having heard that it was clever and witty I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt br br The idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves , through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience What made me dislike the whole film were two things br br First of all , the film was so down to earth that it looked as if , by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis , it became itself ordinary and dull br br Secondly , the overall sloppiness of the production , with dialogues that were barely understandable br br Too bad 
slow , incomprehensible , boring Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book This is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book The best part of the movie was the scenery , excellent The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances The editing is abrupt and patchy However , despite this , the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script It was startling that although set in Peru there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering about the set even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century If you have any sense of history , try to avoid this movie 
 The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake Unbeknownst to the locals , a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake The meteor heats the lake , turning it into a giant incubator You guessed it , the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community br br What utter garbage It 's not that I mind the stop motion clay dinosaur , it 's everything else about the movie that bothers me The acting is atrocious The dialogue is utterly ridiculous The comic relief is anything but comic Logic is non existent Any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie , but you get the idea I feel it 's fairly safe to call this disaster MST3K Worthy 
This film really disappointed me The acting is atrocious Unbelievable And it 's about actors The story is incredibly obvious A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and , in turn , they start to live out the lives of the characters they play I 've been watching a lot of movies lately , thanks to Netflix , and this is the first one I have n't watched all the way through in a long time I felt I did n't need to see the end we all know the end of this story br br For some , it seems , this modernization of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening I cannot speak to any of this as I was n't raised in the Christian church That being said , I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture I'm curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion , for better or worse I have n't seen Mel Gibson 's version , but I'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this , except for the most conservative I just wish this was a better film br br Lots of these reviews praise Arcand 's direction and especially the cinematography I liked neither The film itself is rather prudish and preachy I did n't believe the characters' personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives The play within the play is very much dated and would not , I think , carry it 's own weight in a real time production But that 's beside the point What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal br br There were two examples of this that come easily to mind Firstly , there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple the lead actor , who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer , becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial \( with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience \) with her pants off He trashes the place and chases them all out I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high school rendering of Death of a Salesman , i e , not well Please stop hitting me over the head with this high handed significance The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who , eventually , turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays corrupt Church Why Why does she sleep with this guy It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain Ah , the saintly whore and the lovable old coot It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters They are going through the motions and I'm reaching for the eject button br br Feel free to write me off as bored , jaded or just not interested Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion , in all its beauty , sadness and inspiration , delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel But do n't say I did n't warn you 
For all of the hype about this film , I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think And , although a bit slow at times , the first 90 of the movie is quite good , with more than a few old time scares that make one jumpy and unsettled I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes Where Dark Remains fails , however , is in its climax The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and , the answer I was seeking most what REALLY happened to Emma \? was not elucidated upon ! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best , and in the end , I felt very cheated What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending 
Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series , with John Howard in the role Usual funny banter and antics , but not much plot Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector , swapping disguises to follow Drummond , Algy , and Tenny on a wild goose chase \( mostly in circles perhaps the budget was tighter than usual \) to rescue poor Phyllis , who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom For those keeping score , in this one , Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby 's christening It 's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler 's Rest , but little of it rises above silly 
The trailers get you to the movie , but the movie just was n't worth my 8 50 it has some good effects , but the storyline yech , i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors , they have both done some good films , but i wish they had n't added this one to their resume 's To be honest , the book is better 
I stopped five minutes in when Beowulf was given a double shot , automatic crossbow with sights on it Not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights , but Beowulf beat Grendel in hand to hand combat The terrible , wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci Fi Original Movies did n't help either Having only gotten a few minutes in before I felt my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead , that 's really about all I have to say But , you might as well just realize that it 's a made for TV movie and skip it right there br br A travesty 
Here 's a horror version of PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT \( they wish ! \) starring Melinda Mindy \( RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3 \) Clarke as Candy , a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny \( Jason Durr \) He ends up in a South of the border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw \( an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee \) She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they 're transformed by a newly fallen meteor The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen bitches and Candy develops a VERY long , talking , killing forked tongue she ca n't control Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications br br First off , Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes , very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises , including an eye popping , skin tight latex bodysuit and wonder how come this actress is n't a huge star It 's too bad the rest of this cult attempt does n't live up to her promise br br Blame director scripter Sciamma , who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs but his vulgar gags , annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor Another nail in the coffin the film looks cheap , lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film , because she alone keeps you watching 
If you liked the Grinch movie go watch that again , because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times His voice accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound , which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater Not even the kids liked this one folks , and kids laugh at anything now Save your money and go see Looney Tunes Back in Action if you 're really looking for a fun holiday family movie 
This film on paper looked like it could possibly be good , after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible ! ! The plot has no meaning , and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous I watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music , what they would call tragic music , they play opera i mean be serious ! ! This film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film To be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish , ENJOY ! ! 
After just 15 minutes into this film , I began to miss Zhang Yimou 's earlier , more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of China from unique perspectives His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar , with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now \( and understands and can speak some Mandarin \) , I'm sure my opinion is different from many others as I'm coming from a different background SMMF , like Hero , is not really a traditional a kung fu film , and it 's certainly not a wuxia pian film There are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story \( all 3 \) , The Butterfly Murders , Green Snake , et al While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do , SMMF features bland , and sometimes laughable , dialogue combined with cardboard acting Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck There 's an air of superiority with this film that 's really quite insulting It takes itself so seriously , it just becomes a huge joke by the end All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history , they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions , and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se , or simply a showcase \( i e an ego booster \) for Zhang Ziyi The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film Her acting range really has n't extended past her ability to play a naive w itch She 's so concentrated on her acting , she comes across as cold and lifeless , as though she 's reading her lines from a notecard It 's so funny to hear American critics and film people \( like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino \) call this film a masterpiece I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest , they 're tricked into thinking it 's brilliant film making Ching Siu Tung 's choreography , while still retaining his trademark style , editing , and postures , lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story , Dragon Inn , and Duel to the Death Sadly to say , the wirework in this film is really subpar , and if there 's subpar obvious wirework , then you probably should n't have filmed it at high speed The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct B movie feel to them Beans , daggers , bowls , arrows , swords , and other random objects fly through the air \( after being thrown \) with no regard for logic , turning , climbing , and banking as though there 's a little pilot inside I know that logic does n't really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films , but if you do n't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience , then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more Mass melodrama , unintentionally funny dramatic moments , boring fight scenes , really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu It 's obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did After watching Hero and SMMF , I 've come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films , he 's definitely off to the right start SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films And I thought Hero was bad 
It 's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments , what 's so difficult about capturing the robbers \? Just eliminate the bank workers , see who was at the bank from all the cameras' footage angles prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages Where is the suspense every body is talking about \? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times At least Mr Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting The Movie is not worth it Pronto ! 
Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canada 's British Columbia He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas br br From 1945 until 1962 when he retired , Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns , some of them considered real classics Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns br br It 's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use The story is downright silly at times Williams who was along for the ride with Scott , he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time He does n't blame the rustlers , he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm br br Also there 's a scene in the film when Scott , Lee Tung Foo , and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians They escape because Gabby 's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape I'm not sure that would have played in a Rogers film br br Furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold br br This was Gabby Hayes 's farewell feature film part It would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this br br I will say this , though no Caribou made any appearance in the film , this is one of the few Canadian locale films from the past that did NOT have any Mounties br br But if I were you unless you are a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes , take the next detour off The Cariboo Trail 
Even in a bad film , there is usually some redeeming feature , something that you can say yes it was terrible , but there was that performance , or that part of the script , or that special effect , this was just simply terrible all over The acting was laughable , the script terrible , complete with many inexplicable Breakfast at Tiffany 's references , and even the special effects were shoddy at best This was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes was expunged from history Watch it if you want to a \) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain b \) See just how bad a film can be This is one film where I can use the clich there 's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back with some justification ! 
 \( possible spoilers \) br br Someone once asked Dr Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas He turned them down , insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 \( also in mind , perhaps , was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953 's The 5 , 000 Fingers of Dr T \) When the good Dr died in 1991 , his widow , Audrey Geisel , still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality , Mrs Geisel had a change of heart Universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result Well , Mrs Geisel , that makes one of us br br The film was given a 123 , 000 , 000 budget \( which is more than even Heaven 's Gate cost , including the adjustment for inflation \) , which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup , set design , and special effects \( which are undermined br br somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography \) Unfortunately , it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman \( scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit \? , which made much better br br use of a high budget \) turned in Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials , this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch It turns out that , as a child , he was the subject of ridicule , including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr Grinch is directly because of the Whos Trouble is , it seems like a rather long 105 minutes , with too much dead wood clogging up the story That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more well , Grinchy The character that Dr Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change \( and exponential growth \) of heart Carrey 's Grinch is a loud , hyperactive oaf and , at times , a thug who , when made the holiday `Cheermeister , ' trashes the Whoville town square in anger br br \( hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked \) This undermines the script 's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic , with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic \( at least in this interpretation \) br br The Whoville of Dr Seuss 's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled , selfish , materialistic ninnies an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism This is offensively br br hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism , and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising br br campaign br br The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who , a small but crucial character in the original The innocent two year old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser , constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch 's point of view \( her one major scene from the original is re enacted , making it seem out of character \) She br br seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations , thus making her a completely different , and more annoying , character br br Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their br br stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong , overacted , excruciatingly tedious , ham handed , crude attempt to turn the children 's classic into a feature film It proves once and for all that darkness , vulgarity , br br manipulation , and heavy handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm , wit , sincerity , and heart The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious 123 million stink bomb grossed 260 million domestically or they 'd not be here today Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible ! 
Well , were to start \? This is by far one of the worst films I 've ever paid good money to see I wo n't comment on the story itself , it 's a wonderful classic , but here it feels like a soap opera To start with , the acting , except for Eric Bana , is soap opera quality I 've always been a fan of Brad Pitt , but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame The camera action does n't help , either How it lingers on him when he 's thinking , it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester 's days in the lab ! Peter O'Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery , or he is desperately in need of one Either way , he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans ! And to end my comments , Diane Kruger is a cute girl , but she sure is no Helen of Troy Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role , since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now 
I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse But worse funnier ! And funnier better If you 're a bad movie fan like I am , this is great material If , however , you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot , acting ability , or movie making skill , this is best avoided The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast forward Hilariously bad See it for a laugh , see it for mindless entertainment , but whatever you do , see it for free on TV 
This was a quite brutal movie There were huge implausibilities , and a silly script , bad acting , etc br br The only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed 
I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television But the version put to DVD was a disaster The lighting was poor to non existent and entire scenes were simply excised In one instance Adele is being put to bed , and we immediately cut to another scene coming in in mid sentence where it 's the next night Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced , leaving one to wonder if they 'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie br br The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at 6 32 it was a gyp br br Be careful which version of this movie you buy ! We 're sending this one back 
Alexandre Aja 's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film , but it was pretty damned good too So , nearly a year later , we are being treated to the sequel to that remake While original scripter Wes Craven is back as producer and co scripted , this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake A group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film \( at least those that remain plus some new ones \) There 's plenty of gore to be had here What annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we have n't gotten into them Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time , nothing Gore for the sake of gore is pointless There has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting Nothing that happens here is interesting And what is it lately with rape scenes in films \? Here we get yet another one for no real reason Hopefully this is one set of hills that wo n't be visited again 
This was one of the worst movies EVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It was so bad , I was laughing through the WHOLE movie ! The plot was SO cheesy especially the end This movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the eels ! I mean , c'mon ! And I swear I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels ! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced How predictable ! It was SO terrible that my mom , my sister , and I could n't finish it , and when we DID finish it , it was about a year later ! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time , we did MST3K like comments throughout the movie br br Summary Only watch this if you 're a movie basher ! Make hilarious comments , watch this at a sleepover for laughs , and I mean HUGE laughs Also watch for mockery The metaphor that explains this movie This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets ! 
A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers , who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark infested waters As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters , I thought this might be my kind of movie it was n't ! ! ! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it ! It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke , in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling , the feet are obviously waving in the air ! It looks ridiculous ! Good for a laugh though If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors , the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile , it would be at least worth a laugh , but it gets worse I 'd guess , the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was , so they though up the old idea of sex sells Totally , i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast And somewhere towards the beginning there 's some kind of meaningless makeout This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me It 's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish ! If you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie ! ! ! 
I want so badly to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero , unfortunately , there is n't , so , I had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is ! The characters look like they were drawn by pre schoolers , no , wait , I 've seen pre schoolers do better ! I prefer Misadventures of Flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon ! I'm probably saying what others have said , two words RIP OFF ! ! Remember that episode of Dexter 's Lab when they raced go karts down that volcano \? yeah , Mister Fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed ! They even ripped off Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied Pokemon ! \( he even cashed in on that franchise ! \) That one character is a cheap rip off of Mandark from Dexter 's Lab ! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap ! ! Everyone has their own opinion , but those of you who like Johnny \( RIP OFF \) Test , your'e just lying to yourselves Do yourself a favor , change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen ! 
I sat through this turkey because I had n't seen it before , and because the premise sounded like it had potential It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence At the height of the storm , the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house , yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving ! In fact , when the characters move outside the house , bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops At that point , whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film Too bad all hurricanes are n't like this one , it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State 
I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and I was straight up blown away by how bad it was br br First off , the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love \? Or who , say , know the self involved white people in love \? I know it 's not the love Crash of anvil tastic inclusiveness but you ca n't pretend to have a cinematic New York with out these fairly prevalent members of society Plus , you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that ham handed Oscar , so where is everyone \? br br Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters \( remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs \? Me either \) This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst Bad acting , bad writing , bad directing all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants br br But thank god they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back together for that Jumper reunion And , side note , Uma dodged a bullet Ethan Hawke looks ravaged This , of course , is one thing in terms of his looks , but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor , lovely Maggie Q br br I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire , but it has to be the Anton Yelchin Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste , which saddens me because I really like those two actors I do n't consider myself easily offended , but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone 's 50 year old aunt br br A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf 's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie I do n't mean opposite , I mean against Against is the only explanation I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight HIGHLIGHT Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits , which seem to be a nod to the first New York Real World This film is embarrassing , strangely dated , inarticulate , ineffective , pretentious and , in the end , completely divorced from any real idea of New York at all br br \( The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman Eli Wallach sequence , as it is actually quite sweet , but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless , masturbatory torment \) 
The main problem with Power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever It gets boring after awhile , sitting around waiting through scenes that do n't connect to find something that drives the movie forward You could probably pass it all off as character development , but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie , or are just simply to flat and uninteresting Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom He should have cut a few of the characters \( hackman , the wife \) and concentrated harder on others \( Billings \) It could have been a great , hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting , a fact that amazed me considering the cast Even Gene Hackman performance was n't up to par Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here Gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere br br Sidney Lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies \( i e , Serpico \) and stop trying to recapture his success with 12 Angry Men and Fail Safe It has n't worked yet Sidney , and it most likely never will leave the ensemble dramas to Altman br br 3 10 br br 
This clever film was originally a Japanese film And while I assume that original film was pretty bad , it was made a good bit worse when American International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American made segments to fool the audience Now unless your audience is made of total idiots , it becomes painfully obvious that this was done and done with little finesse or care about the final product The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different Plus , the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera the evil flying turtle ! And although this is a fire breathing , flying and destructive monster , there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film in particular , film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker They both just looked tired and ill at ease for being there br br Now as for the monster , it 's not quite the standard Godzilla like creature Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious On the other hand , the crappy model planes , destructible balsa buildings and power plant are , as usual , in this film and come as no surprise Plus an odd Japanese monster movie clich is included that will frankly annoy most non Japanese audience members , and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him Yeah , right Well , just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films , you 've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster , though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla , Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot ! Silly , exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year old , bad acting , meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film Oddly , while most will surely hate this film \( and that stupid kid \) , there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa Do n't believe them this IS a terrible film ! br br FYI Apparently due to his terrific stage presence , Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations None of these change the central fact that he is a fire breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really , really lame 
Revolt of the Zombies is BAD There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie It is dull , lifeless , poorly acted , and poorly scripted I 've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste , well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes br br The story An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him Once this happens , he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences That 's it That 's the whole story br br For most of the movie , I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead He looked so familiar I had plenty of time to think this over Nothing was happening in the movie Just before the zombies revolted , it hit me It was Dean Jagger I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas This is how I entertained myself throughout most of the movie br br I'm just glad I did n't buy the DVD for this movie King of the Zombies is on the other side and it 's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie For what it 's worth , I 'll give it a 2 10 \( I wo n't go to 1 10 because , believe it or not , I 've seen worse \) 
I loved Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy and hoped this would be just as funny , but alas , it was n't Some bits are excellent though I thought the sports guy , Champ Kind , professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which does n't get acknowledged either But on the whole the story does n't gel It 's a noble attempt , however , to salvage the unused bits from the first movie , including an entire plot about some pretty benign would be domestic terrorists called The Alarm Clock Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines , but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie The extras on this disk are pretty good , with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy , and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an exec producer who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way , shape or form Turns out he 's just a guy who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer It 's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox His strong visual sense is , as usual , undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel 's Mexican period , and looks at times like a poor man 's take on Lars Von Trier 's Elements of Crime Cox 's apparent preference for single takes , jump cuts , and ambient sound recording all work against the film 's effectiveness Worth a look but ultimately disappointing 
This is absolutely the worst trash I have ever seen When I saw it in the theater \( arghhh ! \) , it took 15 full minutes before I realized that what I was seeing was the feature , not a sick joke ! 
With the runaway success of God 's Army , every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now In the case of the recent The Other Side of Heaven , this was n't at all a bad thing That film , while not great , was quite good The Singles Ward , however , is not br br Telling the story of a young , divorced Mormon guy thrust back into single life , the writing and shooting style of The Singles Ward is , in many ways , very similar to the 80s comedy Ferris Bueller 's Day Off However , the similarities end there While Ferris Bueller was funny , original , and well acted \( as far as stupid comedies like this ever are \) , The Singles Ward is completely the opposite It tries very hard to be funny However , 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you 've probably heard a million times before The other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time And the acting , while not awful , is amaturish at best br br In addition , if you 're not either a Mormon yourself , or very , VERY familiar with Mormon culture , you wo n't get hardly anything at all Whereas God 's Army and The Other Side of Heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers , both inside and outside of the Mormon church , this film is most definitely one big inside joke , and even if you get it , it 's just not that funny 
I went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was It was a combination of every horror thriller clich , trying to comment on many things including pedophilia , Satan worship , undercover cops , affairs , religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty washboard the kid and the Jesus dude were alright , but apart from them Anyways I admire the effort \( though slightly failed \) on the attempt at showing the Christian people in a different way even though they did that , the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish But then again , it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually , I 've decided it 's just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible toooo over dramatic Okay I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier It seemed like a poor student project I'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line , go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go 
I give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth , spoiled , controlling , loud , and her bi sexual past makes me laugh She tells Chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs He married her Chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth Here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce I do n't think his old Brady Family is gonna fit into his new life I see them being shut out Chris said his friends were more important than his family The supported him and was there for him

I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap I had wanted to see it for ages , finding the plot outline very intriguing So my disappointment was great , to say the least I thought the lead actor was very flat This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp 's in The Ninth Gate \( of which this is almost a complete rip off \) , but I guess TV budgets do n't always stretch to this kind of acting ability br br I also the thought the direction was confused and dull , serving only to remind me that Carpenter has n't done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness As for the story well , I was disappointed there as well ! There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess , but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor , and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least br br This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN , and you can tell he does love his cinema , but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise br br I took the DVD back to the store the same day ! 
I picked this up at the video store because of Tarantino 's recommendation \( If you do n't like \( this \) , go f yourself ! \) on the box seemed like a ringing endorsement I was expecting something a bit more like Death Proof not much actual violence in this one tho , or plot , of character , or dialogue br br Look at the poster It 's all there Stunts , and rock It goes back and forth A week or so in the life of an LA band that does a crappy magic show , at a level that you 'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the Strip , and an Aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet They work , they meet girls , they party End of story br br The band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second tier , and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling that Aussie fellow really is something , and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art I hung it there to see what crazy thing he 'd do next Just wish he could have found a better vehicle 
While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film , it 's surprisingly watchable on several levels First , for old movie fans , it 's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger \( no relation to Mick \) While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor \( even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH \) , here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair \( I never saw him this way before \) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films does n't mean he ca n't eventually learn to be a great actor Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman , whose first movie \( THE SILVER CHALICE \) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s br br A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all The writing is bad , the acting is bad and the special effects are bad For example , when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water , it 's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them Plus , once they leave the water , their costumes are 100 dry ! ! ! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film so much so that it 's hard to imagine why they did n't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film since both of them starred in many grade z horror films In many ways , this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film br br So , while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over generous , it 's fun to laugh at and short so it 's worth a look for bad film fans 
Beaudray Demerille \( a weak Peter Fonda , who also directed \) , an aging gambler , wins young teen Wanda Nevada \( pretty , but not talented Brooke Shields \) in a poker game Together the unlikely pair \( of course \) embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon br br That 's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it It just is n't there The acting is very weak too , which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead br br If you 're looking for something interesting in this film , take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields Her character however is so irritating \( especially at the beginning \) and dumb , that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing Too bad , but , given the story , I doubt anything more could be made of this I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film He must have even talked his father \( Henry Fonda \) into a \( useless \) cameo in this ridiculous mess Unfortunately , this was their only film together Could n't Henry be in EASY RIDER for example \? 3 10
This is not the video nastie , but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain It is 75 a rehash of The Boogeyman , and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was br br I was initially confused as I thought that Annie \( Kelly Galindo \) may have been a different Lacey , but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person br br After seeing a murder in a bathroom , and also seeing the address as well , Annie , her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials , head to the house , and , sure enough , it 's the same bathroom 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described Of course , we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered br br Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original Notably , the boogeyman is shown unlike the original Sadly , some of the good scenes were cut , but 90 of it is there Why rerun this film \? Did they find the footage in the trash \? What was the purpose \? br br We 'll never know and , despite the psychologist telling Annie she is cured , we all know the bogeyman will never die 
What The Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe We are presented with a parade of apparent experts \( none of whom are named \) who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner Their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini plots br br The film pilfers themes from science , philosophy , theology and politics , minces them together without any regard for accuracy , and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions We are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence , and any other difficult to answer question the film makers would like to point their finger at br br It is riddled errors and logical non sequiturs How did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo scientific spirituality and mysticism \? It 's like saying 'two plus two equals four , therefore I can move objects with my mind' br br There is nothing original in this film , and almost nothing that is accurate Any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy handed editing , intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance Educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on 
I was so disappointed in this movie I do n't know much about the true story , so I was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history With such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination Well , somewhere the screenplay failed them It was so scattered is this movie about his childhood \? his love life \? his own disability \? his speaking ability \? his passion for the disabled \? I'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story , but this movie was n't it I was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities , but because of their personalities Other small gripes 1 The heavy handed soundtrack It 's the seventies WE GET IT ALREADY ! 2 If he 's such a phenomenal public speaker , why were n't we treated to more than a snippet here and there and even then mostly in montages \? 
Somehow they summed up the 60 's , ten years that radically changed our country , in four hours And what a painful four hours it was They trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african american family If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash What was amusing was this happy go lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways , but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country And the second family was such a non factor They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family That poor son Please NBC , do not make any movies about any other eras leave that to PBS and the History Channel
No matter what anyone tells you , there is a mere fact to the word possession in film circles such as what possessed you to greenlight this film \? Religion does n't have anything to do with it , but common sense does That is , if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment br br On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain or even interest the average consumer The star \? The story \? The unique idea \? A buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman \? On , my goodness ! I am sure when this was an idea , it sounded good But somewhere during the course of development someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see br br Regardless , this is a complete mess Mess , mess sin and a mess br br Who cares about the plot \( what plot \? \) et al Whoopie got a paycheck , but I would have been embarrassed to take it I sure hope she fired her agent manager publicist over this career move Obviously not , she went on to make more bad films And more bad films Sad 
Wow That 's about as much as I can say right now Who writes this stuff \? Who produces this stuff \? What self respecting actor would agree to 'act' in this stuff \? Oh my GOD ! I do n't know how I made it through this movie , but I assume the fact that I had had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake Good Lord ! It was one of the most droned out and predictable pieces of cinematography I have ever witnessed and for the record , I do n't EVER plan to 'witness' it again br br I first saw the film when I bought the DVD \( MISTAKE 1 \) I mean I figured , hey ! Julia Stiles I like her She 's cool I 'll watch it as soon as I get home \( MISTAKE 2 \) I tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end , really I did But I was unsuccessful It was one of the worst things I had ever seen I mean what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life \? That was annoying enough when the father used to do that in 'Parenthood' like ten years ago The 'jokes' and BELIEVE me , it takes a LOT out of me to call them that are stupid , the characters are trite and forgettable , the storyline is entirely predictable altogether this makes for a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORY RECORDS ! I should have figured something was wrong when I realized that I 'd never heard of this movie It was most likely a straight to DVD br br To anybody who may be thinking of watching this , I have one piece of advice DON'T ! For the LOVE of God DON'T ! ! ! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection , and I ca n't get rid of it Nobody , and I mean NOBODY wants to buy it from me ! And I'm talking second hand and third hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window That should let you know just how CRAP it is 
The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that I have to assume that that was the desired intent The sets are artificial and at no time did I not feel that I was watching a movie It seemed like the actors were just reading their lines , rather than responding to one another While the film has elements of early film noir \( except that it is in color \) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre br br Given that the presentation had no appeal to me , I was at least expecting an engaging story Usually I am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists , but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes By the time of the , Gee , I forgot the 80 , 000 , moment , I thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief If at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person , the whole story would have fallen apart br br This wooden production left me cold 
In Theodore Rex poor Whoopi Goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case The movie tries to be funny , and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works The movie is far from funny , and the story is ridiculous I voted 1 10
Many things become clear when watching this film 1 \) the acting is terrible Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so so , but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish The other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I'm a babe but I'm really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat 2 \) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing 3 \) Robbie 's dreams and episodes are disturbing \( acted by Tom Hanks \) 4 \) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice \( we are all special friends \) 5 \) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and 5 \) this is a really bad movie Expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed 
i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan \( releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture \) , it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction Give us more of herapheri 's and malamal weekly 's rather than giving duds like garam masala ! 
By my Kool Aid drinkers remark , I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre ! ! ! When this film debuted , I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as No , Giorgio and some said it was among the worst films ever made This is definitely overstating it as well While bad and far from a great work of art , there was a lot to like about the film and the movie 's biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth br br Believe it or not , the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers \( who , I believe , were chimps \) It is rare to see a movie with such clich d dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight , but even they are n't the heart of the problem The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middle aged man and a seemingly desperate lady Perhaps European audiences might be more forgiving of this , but in the United States in 1982 or today , such a romance seems sleazy and selfish especially when Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and this is just fun Wow , talk about romantic dialog ! ! Sadly , if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films , such as from ALL THIS AND HEAVEN , TOO or THE SUSPECT \( where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her \) Instead , she 's the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and left as Pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting Harrold br br Sadly , even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti could n't save this film Towards the end of the film , there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible and Pavarotti 's singing transcendent For that reason , I think the movie at least deserves a 3 I really wanted to like the film more , but it was a truly bad film though not quite as rotten as you might have heard br br Sadly , from what I have read , this film might be a case of art imitating life , as Pavarotti 's own life later had some parallels to this film , though this is n't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail 
Profanity , stupidity , self indulgence , and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie making Pesci 's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke , shows the opposite instead He is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead A true must miss ! 
It was Jon Pertwee who said It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is Very easy David Baker \( As Director Screenwriter \) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin br br PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation that you still get paid to donate blood in America People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots \? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
Disappearance is set in the Mojave desert as Jim \( Harry Hamlin \) Patty Henley \( Susan Dey \) plus their two kids Katie \( Basia A'Hern \) Matt \( Jeremey Lelliott \) along with Ethan \( Jamie Croft \) a friend of the family are travelling along , they stop at a roadside diner ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called Weaver No one claims to have heard of it but it 's definitely there the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out take some pictures Once at the town they take some pictures have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car wo n't start they have to spend the night there While looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared , the next morning their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn What is Weaver 's secret \? Will the Henley 's ever leave there alive br br Written , co executive produced directed by Walter Klenhard I have to say that Disappearance is one of the most frustrating films I have ever watched For the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history The script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms I was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on , from the families car mysterious disappearing , the four recent graves , the thing in the abandoned mines , the supernatural sandstorm , the sudden unexplained disappearance of Ethan his just as unexplained reappearance , the Sheriff 's sinister motives , the compass in the car going crazy , the crashed plane , the townspeople denying Weaver existed the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near Weaver in the 40 's but they are all tossed out of the window for all we know could have been totally separate random events Everything was coming along nicely was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming instead I was treated to the most ambiguous , strange , surreal downright frustrating ending possible If nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before leaves the viewer with more questions than answers It 's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then did n't know what to do with them just made the ending up on the spot I just felt I put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute ! br br Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here , the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation It 's well made but what were they thinking with that ending \? Nothing fits , nothing makes sense it 's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour a half leaves you confused wanting to know more Despite being a horror film there 's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here there The film actually reminds of The Hills Have Eyes \( 2006 \) remake for large parts as that is what the film is set up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film br br Technically the film is good with high production values , good special effects , sets , locations cinematography Set in America but filmed in South Australia The acting is fine from a decent cast br br Disappearance is a really odd film , for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers I really ca n't see anyone making head nor tail of this , I really ca n't

Some gorehound friends recommended Live Feed to me , and basically I ca n't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze , but it is of course not a very good film More than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema , the so called Torture Porn , Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre \( and that includes the role models Hostel and Saw \) with its sick twisted make up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co eds tried up , suffering and begging for their lives There 's no actual plot to describe Five utterly brainless twenty something friends take a trip to Asia One of them has Asian roots , but other than that I do n't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to Cancun They 're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan A simply apology clearly does n't suffice , as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes Live Feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook , even if you 're used to watching independent fan boy trash cinema like this The fat bloke depicted on the cover , an oriental S M executioner , is admittedly quite cool and he 's also the most talented of the whole bunch , because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time I would n't exactly recommend this pile of filth , but hey , if you like loud hideous metal music , nauseating torture footage and dim witted losers , go right ahead and watch ! 
Maaan , where do i start with this god awful movie Bad bad bad story telling I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest even the soundtrack was good But in this one oh my good for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one the songs are soooo bad AR Rahman should have been the music director br br Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director Even though the first half sucks , the last 30 mins of the movie are OK Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster br br Watch it if you have nothing better to do The last good movie from Bollywood i watched \( and i do watch a load of them \) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid 
This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film They should have let it remain that way br br What a colossal bomb ! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus What I 'll Do to that Hungarian ! br br The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror \( Fairbanks \) Now , let 's fast forward to 300 years later , where Grable , just married to the Count Romero , faces a similar situation , when on her wedding night , there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers br br Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases Fairbanks The ending is worse than the entire wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news an enraged Romero has annulled the marriage br br This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 As Harry Davenport , a veteran supporting player who is in it , died in 1949 this must have been his last film What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career br br Walter Abel co stars but he can do little with such poor writing The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age I ca n't fathom what Fairbanks was wearing 
Set in the 70s , Seed centers around convicted serial killer Max Seed \( Will Sanderson \) , who killed 666 people in 6 years He is sentenced to death , but in the electric chair he does n't die , even after being shocked three times br br Detective Matt Bishop \( Michael Par \) and other officers cover up this secret by burying Seed alive Seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin br br Filmed by the worst director in the world \( Uwe Boll \) , Seed is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline And he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times , they will be set free This is an urban legend , and it would never happen Much like Boll 's other abominations \( Alone in the Dark for one \) , Seed is just utterly horrendous 
I thought I had seen this movie , twice in fact Then I read all the other reviews , and they did n't quite match up A man and three young students , two girls and a boy , go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw , despite the discrepancies in the reviews Therefore I'm putting my review back If you like the occasional 'B' movie , as I do , then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you ! Whether it 's setting the sleep timer , and nodding off to your favorite movie bomb , or just hanging out with friends Boggy Creek , the mute button , and you 've got a fun night of improv Look out ! Is the legend true \? I think we just might find out , along with a not so stellar cast Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film \? Does our blonde , manly , young hero have any chest hair \? Will the exceptionally high tech Technicolor last the entire film \? You 'll have to watch to find out for yourself 
This film is just a shame Orlando , Florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area \( like Vancouver 's rise to prominance \) The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area \( which made great strides with the Indie film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon \) br br I will try to be as honest as possible I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers It had the potential to give a new spin on the 'Boy Band' craze After all , both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area But , The Brothers falls short probably because of a weak script Both lead characters are flat with almost no development \( part of this could be the amatuer actors , but some of it is certainly the way the script was written \) br br Also a problem is the choice of jokes Many of the jokes are too repetitive \( they do come off funny the first time , but it does grow to be a bit boring \) Some of the 'concert' scenes are staged poorly \( and many of these scenes also do n't seem to move the story along in any way \) br br I had high hopes for this one , but alas its a disappointing effort I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres \( quickly \) Comedy is n't his strong suit But , its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the Orlando area \( its just a shame that right now he 's infamous , not famous \) br br 
As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version , it is all macabre , Germanic , sinister nonsense It reminded me of Nazis falling in love who cares \? br br This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress , played by Mae Murray , possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again I like my romances light and beautiful , with slow build ups not harsh and sadistic like this one And come on , those bee stung lips , get rid of them , girl ! br br Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar Failing that , wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald Maurice Chevalier sound version It 's much better 
This is a really dumb movie It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting , but it just is n't br br Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween They come to Earth to kill humans , but instead of killing , they make people their slaves and act goofy The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space not really what they do These are n't party aliens , they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the Jack Nicholson rip off alien who always wears his sunglasses Other than the aliens , the acting is terrible The writing is obviously meant for children , because every character is written like a kid br br This is a dumb movie , that only children will appreciate , maybe br br My rating 1 2 out of 100 mins PG for mild language 
That word 'True' in this film 's title got my alarm bells ringing They rang louder when a title card referred to America 's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' \( the circumlocution preferred by die hard southerners \) Jesse James thief , slave holder and murderer is described as a quiet , gentle farm boy br br How dishonest is this movie \? There is NO mention of slavery , far less of the documented fact that Jesse James 's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war , and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery According to this movie , all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state that 's ALL \( Missouri It 's a candy mint ! It 's a breath mint ! \) Black people are entirely absent from this movie , except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars , one of whom wears a HELP THE POOR sign that 's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten \( Some shots of 19th century newspapers are inaccurate too , with 20th century type fonts \) br br This film has a weird flashback structure There 's some very impressive stunt riding \( and some fine work by stunt horses \) , and one excellent montage I savoured one line of dialogue 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again ' The movie gets a few facts straight Agnes Moorehead , as Jesse 's mother , conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton \( here called 'Remington' \) in which Jesse James 's real life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm Some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days , the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger , but Robert Wagner \( in the title role here \) does not have a stumpfinger I 've seen a photo of Jesse James 's real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie , Jesse James might have stayed home more br br There 's plenty of revisionism here , and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles But many of this movie 's errors were avoidable Jesse James 's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times , but all the actors mispronounce his name We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two storey house \( where he will soon die \) after paying a rent of 18 Actually , Jesse James 's last residence \( at 1318 Lafayette Street , St Joseph , Missouri \) was a simple one storey cottage , renting for 14 There was no upper storey so , when Jesse James is killed , his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here \( She was actually in the kitchen \) br br One continuity error Robert Wagner \( with no stunt double \) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back but when he gets up , the rope binding his wrists has vanished br br The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates Following the Northfield robbery attempt , Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang \( 7 September , 1876 \) was two days AFTER Jesse James 's birthday \( Maybe he meant next year 's birthday \) Later , we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day , while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives but in real life , Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December , 1881 so this scene should BE on Christmas Eve ! These errors were entirely avoidable br br Some of the fictionalisations here do n't make sense According to this movie , the Northfield bank raid failed because one \( fictional \) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires If this had actually happened , it would indeed have hampered the James Gang 's getaway but it would n't have affected the robbery itself , which failed for other reasons br br There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter \( as Frank James \) , Moorehead , Alan Hale Jnr \( as Cole Younger \) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role I was disappointed by Robert Wagner , normally an under rated actor Elsewhere , Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes , villains and morally ambiguous characters Here , he ca n't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie so he does n't much bother John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding In fact , Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle , a Methodist minister but perhaps this second baptism is a topping up br br Jesse James was no Robin Hood \( I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either , but that 's another story \) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family After some of his hold ups , he did n't even split the swag with the rest of his gang In this movie , Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever In reality , the night before his death , Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank As preparation for most of his robberies , Jesse James stole horses from local farmers the same poor folk who \( in the inaccurate legends \) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse I cringed at one scene here , in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes br br 'The True \( not much ! \) Story of Jesse James' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer , and likewise dishonest about the Civil War For the very impressive stunt work , one good montage and a few fine acting turns , I 'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10 
When I was a teen ager seeing this film for the first time , I thought it was one of the best movies ever made Of course , the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film However , now that I'm older , I can honestly say that this film is awful Mind you , Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful , and she and husband director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her But when you take that aspect out of the film , it becomes one big dull ride And Tarzan , well , he 's all muscular like you think he should be , but when he sees Jane \( that 's Bo , of course \) for the first time , he does n't know what to think This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see thru shirt , with her breast prominently displayed Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body , then this might fill the ticket If you are looking for a thoughtful , entertaining and worth while film , go elsewhere almost anywhere else at that ! ! ! 
I have to say this is an awful movie , for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide , it is listed as a documentary As I watched it , I started laughing , thinking to myself , does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real \? So I had to look it up , and now see that it is a movie , but now since it is n't a documentary , it is now a movie with bad acting SO , either way , it is pretty bad I actually did n't make it to the end I had to shut it off I am a NYC Police Officer , and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary , with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers So , I took it a little personal Maybe I was blinded by that , and it is n't as bad as I personally think it is Everyone has their own opinion 
If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of The Eden Formula This wondrous film must have cost all of 50 to make It features a wafer thin script , pathetically bad sets , lighting and camera work , and a stop motion , paper mache monster that is utterly laughable \( it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a glove puppet for the monster but all were equally dreadful \) br br The actors all speak their lines as though they 've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter The special effects are way beyond lousy And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes br br This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath br br I loved every minute of it 
After Highlander 2 \( which I am still in denial about \) , I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad I was wrong I loved the original Wargames , however , this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor I doubt he or she even watched the original movie The acting is n't even convincing Please save yourselves , under no circumstances watch this movie I do n't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you ca n't turn the TV off THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE 
Unwatchable You ca n't even make it past the first three minutes And this is coming from a huge Adam Sandler fan ! ! 1
I confess Emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here br br Unfortunately , this is at best a palimpsest br br Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch br br There are some good elements here Kate Berkinsale \( having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm , clearly Emma 's smarter spiritual twin \) is a wonderful Emma Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill The production is handsome , but the interiors are far too dark br br However , there are several major problems The first is Mark Strong first of all , he does n't look right for Mr Knightley This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson It 's badly out of tune br br The second problem is one of length Simply put , the film is much too short to get the right kind of feel , it would need to be twice as long br br Finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation Austen is an adapter 's dream all the dialogue is there already It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise First , this is a rather gloomy film , and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy More significantly , Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast What planet , or minor work of Thomas Hardy , is this come from \? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon perfection br br Watch the Paltrow version , or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm 
Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series , or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector , the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them , the NCC 1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name need I go on \? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry 's creation After he died , they only saw and just went their own way No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series I do n't blame her for not being involved with this mess Poor Bakula He 's a great actor , as are the entire cast I like them all , but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series Just check the ratings I think more people watched Deep Space 9 \( which was untimely canceled \) 
The premise of the movie has been explained and if you 've gotten this far you do n't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3 , and some others \( many \) br br The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong This is a highschoolers approach to cinema For the rest of us we 'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying \( and yes , this does take away from the film \) , the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis , and the acting well hmmm br br If one is a Takashi fan you 'll see it regardless to peak your interests It lacks any originality \( see the Neverending Story \) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co writing , but that does n't mean much as non of what we 'd hope would be Miike 's personality would spill over into the screen All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography br br The movie had the potential to be something great The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with But this one seemed to have been run into the ground br br My suggestion is if you 're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu , Ichi , and Audition Then movie into his works like Blue 's Harp , Fudoh , Rainy Dog , Bird People of China 
I do n't what that other review was talking about This definitely is n't a bimbo movie , in fact , I do n't think there was one decent looking girl in it No , it 's just cheesy , poorly done , Ed Wood style science fiction schlock And it 's bad I ca n't even begin to tell you how bad it is I saw it late at night on cable , and I was in shock The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded , the special effects are a joke , and the pace is insanely slow To me though , the music tops it all A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone Do not rent this thing , but if you ever see it on cable , watch it You 'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be 
Prior to watching Dahmer , I thought no movie could be worse than Freddy Got Fingered I was wrong To sum Dahmer up , it 's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer 's encounters with gay men before they were killed There is no plot to be found , and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about Dahmer All you 'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men Horrible acting , horrible directing , horrible writing , horrible everything If you have to choose between watching Dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours , go with the vomiting it wll be less painful 
I get it the Diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of America itself seeing Arab terrorists under every rock , only to find out at the end that it 's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason , polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well made , amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters , dialog and plotting Better luck on your next flick Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger , these people do n't get enough to eat Truly these folks are n't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger , an emotional hunger , a mental hunger They need self respect , self worth , dignity which you ca n't give a man Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available Less the center for hunger in America , I would say it 's more the center for alcoholism , drug abuse , mental suffering and economic devastation Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age old human problem of homelessness Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet \( cliched \) old soul 
THE IMMORTALIZER was , uh , interesting It certainly did n't kill me during its hour and a half duration , but it did n't impress me much either A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants \( in a scene featuring cinema 's least convincing head crushing sound effect \) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs Here Dr Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again Hey , this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK ! Who knew that when you transplant an old person 's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice \? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum , you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE ANIMATOR dancing in the producers' heads But the production literally does n't have the guts to pull it off I 've never understood why , when someone is making a low budget horror film , that they do n't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore The acting is uniformly terrible , with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr Price He has a nice evil laugh The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts Seriously , most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks 
I simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film It moved me to leave this comment ! This is just an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first film The dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film br br The storyline is ridiculous , the portrayal of the French police laughable and the characterisation of Doyle a mile away from the first film br br How many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in \? The ease at which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic Like all the French Police were just drinking coffee until Doyle turns up from America and does some REAL police work What a joke Try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets Pathetic br br A truly awful sequel , anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy 
When I first saw the preview for this movie , I really could n't wait to see it The plot seemed good and the setting was great I mean , a slasher movie that takes place on prom night , great idea ! ! And the plot A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students , goes crazy , gets arrested , and escapes three years later on prom night ! Prom night , a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable , turns into hell ! ! However , I saw it and was extremely disappointed It was not only the worst horror movie I have ever seen , but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen ! ! First of all , it was n't even scary There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat Also , the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats Also there was absolutely no gore \( its rated PG 13 \) The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them \( they do n't actually show him cutting her throat \) br br Next , you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie He is n't mysterious , creepy , or scary He 's just this guy who kills people br br Also , everything in the movie was so clich An example is when , at the end , the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment , the detective shoots and kills him Also , every single thing in this movie was so predictable The victim , after seeing the guy with a knife , runs for her life , hides , thinks she gets away , and then the killer just pops out and kills her br br Finally , the sequence of the movie was extremely bad The guy goes into the hotel , kills a few people , the bodies are discovered , someone pulls the fire alarm , and everyone evacuates The main character forgets something in her room , has an encounter with the killer , runs and escapes Thats it ! She and her boyfriend go home , the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house , finds the girl , then gets killed by the detective The movie sequence was so stupid and clich br br If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good , trust me , do n't waste your time or money No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater My friend and I , along with these two girls sitting in the back , were the only ones in the theater That should have told me something about the movie beforehand 
I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script This is easily THE WORST sequel EVER made br br They KILLED Navin Johnson Not only was Mark Blankfield 's performance GOD AWFUL , so was everyone elses ! ! The physical comedy was forced , flat and predictable The script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci How the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talent less buffoon Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself br br I want the 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so I can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity 
i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars the line about have you even seen the wizard of oz was the best part for me ! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it 's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game , your gonna be glad ya did ! 
By now you should already know about this film , the Jessica Simpson bomb that pretty much went straight to video \( limited , anemic theatrical run \) Basically , Ms Simpson 's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman She is stranded , but has one friend \( Rachel Leigh Cook , whom I wish we saw more often in film \) , who lets her stay Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co workers \( Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick \) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm \( Larry Miller \) ousted This is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying The film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff In a cameo , Penny Marshall is funny \( a subtle in joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle \) , and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests \( do n't read too much into this \) So , not horrible , but easy to skip Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does Again , not good , but not a profound disaster 
Posh Spice Victoria Beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to LA for work purposes \( footballer hubby David is now a Galaxy LA player after his transfer from Real Madrid \) was originally going to be a full series , but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so But even in this form , it is still numbingly interminable br br Like virtually all 'reality' TV shows , most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked , with the programme itself even admitting that Posh 's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress An Ugly Betty lookalike , we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on \( with an obvious joke about Becks' apparent dalliance with a previous , and rather more glamorous PA Rebecca Loos , though her name is not mentioned \) with further sequences involving a fake blow up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball br br This could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff , and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role Talented impressionist Ronni Ancona would 've been perfect and is better at being Posh than Posh herself is , and if this more sensible decision had been taken , much more fun and amusement would 've ensued Sadly , we are left with the real thing here \( Ms Ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway \) , and although there are odd scattered attempts at self deprecation and irony , it never remotely works because of prior info of La Beckham 's considerable wealth beforehand , and her non ability at delivering would be jokes despite the intentions to send up her image , Mrs Beckham comes across as a shallow egotist , and her weak one liners do n't persuade us she has any humorous self awareness I suspect that if a more realistic fly on the wall documentary approach had been taken , namely Posh walking down any street in LA and being totally ignored \( instead of the frantic , staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here \) , and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned Ms Loos , this would 've made marginally better TV , but being sycophantic PR material , the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen br br Having said that , the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in Hollywood Her colleague Scary Spice \( aka Mel Brown \) also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair \( which was not consummated \) with big name Eddie Murphy br br The Spice Girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990 's , more so in their native Britain but still popular briefly in other countries , including the US They were certainly good fun at their peak of glory \( 1997 \) when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the UK with Cool Britannia and a New Labour government which The Spice Girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time , even if it was somewhat manufactured But they were never outstanding musical or singing talents , and UK optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year \( the starting point was arguably the tragic death of Princess Diana \) , as did The Spices' themselves Their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious , and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes , then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt Unfortunately , the emergence of the hideous 'celebrity' culture in the UK towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings , and we have all suffered thousands , if not millions of stories about the Spices since , Posh being the worst offender , with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind It was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon , which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly do n't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts Maybe it 's because two of them are struggling single mothers , perhaps \? br br Good , it 's soon time for Becks' adventures on a revelatory documentary next , I can hardly wait br br Rating 2 out of 10 
This was so lame that I turned the DVD off maybe halfway through It was so weak , I could n't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in I made it Though I really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young Carlito would be somewhat different , I just could n't buy it I do n't really blame the actors , because I think it was the script that may have fallen flat I did find myself laughing a few times , but I do n't think those lines were intended to be funny br br It 's only saving grace is that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I did for the original alone This is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone 
Mere thoughts of Going Overboard \( aka Babes Ahoy \) make me want to weep Throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie It 's not even a supposed so bad it 's good movie I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people ca n't see it Oh the pain , the pain 
This movie promised bat people It did n't deliver There was a guy who got bit by a bat , but what was with the seizures \? And the stupid transformation \? Where was the plot \? Where was the acting \? Who came up with the idea to make this \? Why was it allowed to be made \? Why \? Why \? I guess we 'll never know 
Watchable little semi soaper , but hardly captivating Still , two or three funny moments What amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable McNicol is She plays an invalid \( a leg problem \) , yet she not only is n't the ugly duckling whom men shun , but she is even a man eater and we are supposed to feel for her ! Oh , poor little McNicol , with her leg problem Poor little McNicol \? \? ! She is constantly getting passes from men , and even dumps them without so much as blinking ! At one occasion she even has a premeditated one night affair with a blond stud , and then she tells her newly found French girlfriend quite non chalantly that it took him time to get an erection ! Makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg conscious if every guy wants to hump her Well , almost every guy the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone But otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men ! No shyness , no lack of success with men , and she throws them away like toys the way she dumped Carradine was ridiculous Poor little invalid girl \? \? I do n't think so And yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness Nervousness \? \? The rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems , so this flute scene is absurd and does n't fit into the bigger picture I was also surprised how quickly and eagerly McNicol makes friends with a French woman who is screwing a married guy On the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled woman 's struggle for acceptance \( or something like that \) but it 's nothing like that at all the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves it 's the 80s kind of movie very confusing br br As far as her leg it 's not like she has a big , fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle She only has a normal looking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg , so I really do n't understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female Quasimodo or something , at the beginning of the film It 's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck ! Though McNicol is hardly a major catch Kind of cutish but nothing special , quite average br br But what the hell is Carradine doing playing some kind of a \( relatively \) smooth guy flirting with McNicol and her pal \? ! This guy was in Revenge of the Nerds ! But I guess it 's the same thing with the Carradines in the movies as it is with the Kennedys in politics no matter how ugly , unable , or dumb , all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics , respectively br br Down with nepotism br br If you want to read bogus biographies about the Carradines , and other Hollywood nepotists and morons , contact me by e mail 
This movie is just not worth your time Its reliance upon New Age mysticism serves as its only semi interesting distraction The plot is one that has been re cycled countless times br br I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to prop up the reputation of this drivel Their motivation objectivity is dubious , since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults , but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness br br So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians , or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies television that support their views \? In spite of the poor qualities of production , or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis \? I hope not br br I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie , in spite of the truth 
 A total waste of time Just throw in a few explosions , non stop fighting , exotic cars a deranged millionaire , slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a Hugh Hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes , and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie I really got a laugh out of the Dr Evil like heavily fortified compound The plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent How many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race \? Answer 4 but , did n't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility \? This was written for pubescent males , it plays like a video game I did enjoy the Gulfstream II landing in the desert though 
Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'Annie' The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production It was very clearly made for TV , yet if I found it on my television , I would flick it straight over The children in the film do an alright job , yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in This film lacked the music dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love Johnson , as Annie is at times annoying and over acted you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film Sad to say this sequel was a total flop 
This film is overblown , predictable , pretentious , and hollow to its core The settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart 's War Tom , you ca n't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank ! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing 
I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw type movie or 12 Angry Men \( people piecing together the facts to get at the truth \) Whatever it was , it was poorly done and not worth watching br br I do n't watch movies for blood and gore , but because this film had little else going for it , it should have shown the actual killing more Most were off camera , minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths br br It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence \( given to him by MJH \) into the evidence room \( And would n't MJH a the prosecuting attorney , have had access to that evidence taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back anyway , so she would n't have needed the cop 's help \? \) The others , while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming , still played larger roles in his ultimate demise The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need , etc But the cop 's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did n't know exactly what he was doing The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence , which would have made him more culpable And MJH 's yelling that he \( the cop \) got her in that mess does n't make any sense at all br br It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he she was there and deserved to die The insurance guy , for example , could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them the Oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness , etc Yes , more violent that the gun deaths , but more interesting br br The dialog was n't witty , there were no twists , and the ending was one of the worse \( if not the worst \) I 've ever seen The ending along knocked three stars off my rating br br The actors did a decent job , especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with br br Overall , a waste of time 
A battleship is sinking Its survivors , hanging onto a nearby liferaft , sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks br br Even though Noel Coward 's name is the only one that you notice during the credits , everything that 's cinematic in it is because of Lean And on technical terms , its very good David Lean just KNEW films from the get go There are many moments where Coward 's studied dialogue takes a second seat and Lean 's visual sense takes centre stage Try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end , and that whole scene the tracking shot towards the hymn singing , the scene where we 're inside a house that gets bombed br br Noel Coward is one of the worst actors i 've ever seen He 's totally wooden , not displaying emotion , character or humanity You can see it in his eyes that he 's not really listening to what the other performer is saying , he 's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line br br 7 10 br br Its episodic , a bit repetitive , and the flashbacks overwhelm the story there 's no central story that they advance , just give general insights into the characters Still , its an interesting film worth a watch and a good debut for Lean Its not a very deep or penetrating film , and its definitely a propaganda film , but its also a showcase for Lean 's editing skills its all about how the pieces are put together 
Why did I waste 1 5 hours of my life watching this \? Why was this film even made \? Why am I even commenting on this film \? br br One reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody I cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid , SOMEBODY , SOMEWHERE could watch this and make some sense out of it It is incoherent , it is n't experimental , it 's plain and simple garbage The film follows no plot line whatsoever , just when you think you have something , well you do n't br br I think the ending brought some finality to the film \( no pun intended \) , the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on I do n't think I put a spoiler in here , not that it would matter This film is another must miss in the world of filmdom 
If you liked the first two films , then I'm sorry to say you 're not going to like this one This is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video , probably TV made sequel The still idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski \( Rick Moranis \) is still living with his family and he has his own company , Szalinski Inc Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue , Wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother Then he shrinks his wife and sister in law too Now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger Pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things , e g a toy car roller coaster , swimming in dip , etc Pretty poor ! 
I 've now just realised that by watching this film I have lost valuable precious moments of my life I will never get back Thsi film is n't just poor its dire It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made br br I regret watching this film br br Flixmedia reckons its a race issue , apparently White people do n't like it because it does n't have white actors Mate , I think you 'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br Please stop making crap films
You will recognize the plot immediately Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again Yes , that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s , 80s and 90s But here 's the spooky thing Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter \( s \) roles , Durbin looks much older , as in adult And so do all of her so called siblings br br And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film So you 're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women When Ray Milland and others start hitting on them you get the feeling as if they 're pedophiles , and you might be one , too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out Teens or temptresses , little girls or little foxes , you are never quite sure what you 're supposed to be thinking of them as br br The parents , too , seem very old and the whole film seems very dated br br It is a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it , or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you do n't believe me 
Like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously , I 'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went' , Yea ! ! ! This is it This is the next film we are going to green light ! ! And whoever that person is , should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity Because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script , well , I 'd love to give you my email address and maybe you 'd like to just give away some more money This film is atrocious in every way br br The Wayans are funny , at least they can be They have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way But in here , not only does the premise defy all logic , not only is the acting terrible , not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish , not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find , but they actually want you to pay to see this film Maybe if it was free naaah , it would still be a waste of time br br Usually I 'd be inclined to write some long winded , detailed review about why this film is so bad , but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking This is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack br br 0 10 makes my top ten list of worst films of all time ! 
Think of this film as a Saturday morning live action program from ages ago Even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses ! I ca n't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting , especially in the costume department ! Too many warrior wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over , but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings And who in the world would 've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place \? I thought this was a family movie ! MST3K , here 's another fine gem for your 1999 TV season ! 
No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for The House Next Door from her 1970s novel of the same title , or someone else did it This Lifetime like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough Having read the book a long time ago , we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials , which of course , one ca n't find in this version we watched br br The film 's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body , Ms Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy , the character at the center of the mystery This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better br br The film has a feeling of a cross between Desperate Houswives with The Stepford Wives and other better known features , combined with a mild dose of creepiness The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting 
While not as bad as his game to movie adaptations , this hunk of crud does n't fare much better br br Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does n't make good movies One of these days he 'll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs br br The acting was sub par , the dialog sounded like they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll 's special little 'touches' were seen throughout the whole thing br br Like all Uwe Boll movies , this one just should n't exist br br Plain and simple br br Just like Uwe Boll himself should n't exist 
There is no possible reason I can fathom why this movie was ever made br br Why must Hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another \? \( Cases in point Mister Magoo , The Avengers awful ! \) br br Christopher Lloyd , whom I normally enjoy , was so miserably miscast in this role His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal His ranting , groaning , grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character br br The director must have thought that fast movements , screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants br br Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script I think the writer used It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script As manic as that 1963 classic is , it is far superior to this claptrap in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison br br What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children I just am not sure whose children it was made for Certainly no self respecting , card carrying child I know ! br br If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian , why did n't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic \? br br Unfortunately , IMDB com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers , that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty br br One good thing did come from this movie , the actors and crew were paid I think 
 Shadrach was not my favorite type of movie I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were n't at all believable I also did not believe that Paul 's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family , especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home Their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable It seemed the Dabney 's lifestyle was too exaggerated There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone Who was it \? Her son \? What was the scene supposed to show us \? Why was the scene even included \? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again It seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all There were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me The story concerning Shadrach was nice but I was n't convinced that the Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed 
Okay , first off , Seagal 's voice is dubbed over for like 50 of the film Why \? Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions From the very beginning , you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting , but they make no sense br br That said , the story still sucked and does n't make any sense at all When I got the the end , I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending did n't even make sense br br Avoid like the plague This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse 
The film is a collection of cliche 's on just about anything out there It has no focus whatsoever , no goals , no real message Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous This movie ca n't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists Every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy , unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal Where there is no substance to this exchange , the actors \( regardless of how good they are normally \) ca n't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion , aka raising the stakes Over acting , to put it simply The directing is of no help here Nothing can save this non story It is forced , faked and boring to tears Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who , piercings and flashy 90 's outfits Characters wander without a role , detail and motive Locations are arbitrary This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever , with meaning and art ripped out br br Good DP I 'll give it that br br Some films have flaws This film is Lee 's flaw He sold out , like the rest of them Became irrelevant He has nothing of interest to say anymore br br I have no desire to see anything again from this guy \( whom I 'll refrain from naming from now on \) 
The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen \( Lionel Belmore \) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider \( Melvyn Douglas \) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders , six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks Brettschneider does n't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a Vampire Brettschneider is n't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large Bat , meanwhile the latest victim Martha Mueller \( Rita Carlyle \) has been found Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant Vampire Bat is responsible if it is how 's he going to stop it \? br br Directed by Frank R Strayer The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it 's two stars Atwill Wray their success in the previous years Doctor X \( 1932 \) is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative enticing title may have lead you to believe quite frankly it 's rather dull The script by Edward T Lowe Jr takes itself rather seriously sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers that something could possibly be a Vampire , then for most of it 's duration the film focuses on Brettschneider his incompetent investigations which are , not to put too fine a point on it , boring The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it does n't quite know what it wants to be , the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci fi There is no Vampire Bat , the attempts to fool you are pathetic , all the character 's are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat I know it 's old but that 's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 a bland , flat , dull , boring misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just does n't cut it these days , just look at the original King Kong \( 1933 \) released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today I did n't like it I doubt many modern film goers would either , it 's as simple straight forward as that br br Director Strayer does n't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it 's age , as a whole it 's pretty much point , shoot hope for the best stuff There is n't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House \( 1932 \) Universal 's European set on their back lot are nice add a certain ambiance to things br br Technically The Vampire Bat ca n't compare to anything even remotely modern , for the age of it it 's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong Speaking of King Kong it 's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill , I 'll be kind say the acting is OK br br The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it 's a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it is n't , personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore It 's short it tells it 's story reasonably enough but I must admit I'm not a fan 
I hated this crap , every Friday as part of tgif it was on , and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week If you want to see something funny go watch No On Would Tell Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage , it really is hilarious , shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show This show really makes me sick , I hate those kids , and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest I 've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here I AHet writing 10 lines !

Dick Foran and Peggy Moran , who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND , return for this very minor Universal Horror offering But this time , instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick Babe , we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named Stuff But the results are nowhere near as charming , and the scare level is virtually nil br br Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as The Phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself br br This phantom is not very mysterious , and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness It 's always nice to see perky Moran , but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal 's instantly forgettable misfires

Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie , I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that was n't quite meant to be I watched the first two fight scenes , listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren , and all of the other thrown in Oriental actors , and I found the movie so awful that it was funny Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one liners start flying , the plot falls apart , the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it 's welcome , as it turns into the worst action movie EVER br br Lungren beats out his previous efforts in The Punisher and others , as well as all of Van Damme 's movies , Seagal 's movies , and Stallone 's non Rocky movies , for this distinct honor This movie has the absolute worst acting \( check out Tia Carrere 's face when she is in any scene with Dolph , that 's worth a laugh \) , with the worst dialogue ever \( Brandon Lee 's comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film \) , and the worst outfit in a film \( Dolph in full Japanese attire \) Picture Tango and Cash with worse acting , meets Commando , meets Friday the 13th \( because of the senseless nudity and Lungren 's performance is very Jason Voorhees like \) , in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie br br The good \( how about not awful \) performances go to the bad guy \( who still looks constipated through his entire performance \) and Carrere \( who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing \) Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren 's sidekick , and doing a really awful job at that br br An awful , awful movie Fear it and avoid it If you do watch it though , ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non underwater shots Speaking of the underwater shots , check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight scene ending ever This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill in between the flashes of nudity br br A BAD BAD MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
It really impresses me that it got made The director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality I can think of no other way itd pass script stage What I want you to consider is this while watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there , not enjoying it , just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying Id really like to know what the budget is , guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor I want to write 'the jokes did n't appeal to me' but the reality is for them to appeal to you , you 'd have to be the man who wrote them or a retard So imagine that in script form and this guy got THAT green lit Thats impressive is n't it \? 
This film is beautiful to look at , but is like watching really bad experimental theater The plot \( if there was one \) does n't make any sense But it is very artistic Lots of shots of half dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other 's eyes Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame Mumbling and people wandering wistfully Lingering close ups of faces and bodies By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat , you 'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen br br It is supposed to be about a father and son 's relationship , but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f each other and get it over with If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots , your wish has been granted 
This is absolutely the worst movie I 've seen all year br br First , I will say that the acting was very good , and by all of the cast br br This was apparently meant to be very offbeat , and in that regard it succeeded By the same token , the story revolves around a self centered wannabe , who is a clueless , talentless chronic liar , whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers br br This was worse than watching a car wreck 
This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died br br I ca n't spoil the ending , because I have absolutely no idea what happened I 'll try my best , though There are some kind of lesbian vampires , but they keep swapping bodies , so any character might or might not be the character you 're supposed to think it is , or it might be a lesbian vampire br br Sound confusing \? It 's not as confusing as you might think , since none of the characters make any sense to begin with There 's no plot , no character development , and random people show up , speak a few lines , and then disappear , never to be heard from again There are also zombies , who are possibly the enemies of the vampires , but there 's also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital , so maybe none of this actually happened , and it 's all the main character 's hallucination br br The upside \? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly The special effects are simply mind boggling \( I particularly liked the incredibly slow , awkward fight sequences \) Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent , which adds to the general level of hilarity br br Well worth the price of rental We laughed until we cried 
Very outdated film with awful , clich ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction In addition , Cassavetes and Falk overact constantly A pseudo good movie It takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is The first scene is a total bore , filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges The sound is horrible Camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters No poetry , no subtle psychology , no interesting shots The actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages Very cheap , indeed \( one exception Ned Beattie s nice and simple way of playing the hit man \) 
What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time \? Well , he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could 've been directed by anybody available out of film school and in fact , they probably would 've done a better job They would 've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script br br Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes \( gasp ! \) Except this time around , the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue , nonsensical plotting , and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could 've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe br br As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth , his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing Luckily for him , the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles br br And alas , the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause And the haha , we 're so clever , are n't we \? way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one Sigh br br Instead of seeing this , spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood' , 'Edward Scissorhands' , 'Batman' , or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow' , and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality not shame and ridicule 
In its way , Mister Foe \( originally , and more appropriately , titled Hallam Foe I ca n't see addressing its title character as mister \) , is a tribute to good acting Both Jamie Bell , as Hallam , a physically attractive voyeur creep , and Sophia Myles , as Kate , his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance , are convincing The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life A young man who spies on the intimate details of people 's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp And a woman in Kate 's situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police br br These things are not , however , what happens in the movie Poor Hallam 's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he 's been having an affair Hallam , of course , hates his stepmother and lets he know it She has sex with him Kate 's some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games She looks like his birth mother It all ends happily with Hallam resolving his issues br br Forty some years ago , the play and brilliantly acted movie , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf , had a similarly optimistic ending , with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart The trouble is , it does n't always work that way , especially when nobody really cares In Virginia Woolf , the ending 's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation In Mister Foe , the emotional revelation never really happens 
Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy faux pas it 's desperate to teach us a civics lesson , and it wo n't stop until we 've passed the final exam Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington , where they see the senate in action \( or inaction , if you prefer \) , have a spat with their Senator \( Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career \) , get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children , and meet a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace Henry Wallace ! ! A year later , he was considered a near communist dupe , but in 1944 , he was A OK Add in some truly awful musical moments , a whole lot of flagwaving hooey , and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters , and you 've got a film that must have had Philip Wylie ready to pen Generation of Vipers 2 D C Boogaloo Drastically unfun , Heavenly Days is another reminder that the Devil has all the best tunes 
It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors , locations and genres , i e Douglas , Sutherland , Washington , D C and political thriller , but 'The Sentinel' really hits a low It 's like they had a great idea up front , signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger \( not only do I feel she 's one of the worst actors in Hollywood , but I'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one , and definitely the only bad actor in the film , to win an acting Oscar for 'L A Confidential ' \) But she was n't the only problem Sutherland , who I love as Jack Bauer on '24' once again plays Jack I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men' days Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in Plot Someone , some Secret Service traitor , wants the President dead and Douglas is \( haphazardly \) being framed Will someone believe him \? Actually , no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot half way through , it 's over before you know it And why did someone \( s \) want the President dead \? Is that to be revealed in the sequel \? Too many plot holes , too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'The Sentinel' is If you only see one movie a year , you may not know who the mole is , but anyone who 's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'Law Order' episode you 'll know in the first few frames Was it terrible \? Not really , the cinematography was good , and despite Sutherland playing Jack again , he 's still got it 
This movie is a pathetic attempt , apparently , to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau In order to do this , they cast a 19 year old well , probably not in order to do this There was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out \( if they had even been allowed to do them \) as they should Mary Ann 's boyfriend was my nephew 's age , making her a pedophile Sixth grade , people The definition of pedophile does n't have to include many children all you need is one br br I really do n't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to The reason given is that she is bipolar , rejected the diagnosis , and refused to take her medication It 's understandable , then , that she was not thinking rationally One hopes that she now understands her actions br br Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together , I pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly br br All that aside , Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role 
Trite , clich d dialog and plotting \( the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies \) , hokey music , and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans br br What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi 's work , the rotoscoping , and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him This is Frazetta in motion The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword sorcery movie of the period br br I like to watch this with the sound off , playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead 
This is not a boring movie , the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character , Miles Berkowitz , both film maker and actor here The storyline is simple after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non career , the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera The first question is about how true is all that what is written , what came by chance \? Both answers , yes or no portrays M Berkowitz as a low average human beeing If you look for a self fiction about love like this one , I recommand you to read some independant comic books Chester Brown , Joe Matt br br Beside of this , I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country , France I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant \( that might be true then \) , etc , and for sure the french \( and the whole world \) have lots of griefs against america , but why so much hate \? Do n't think I could n't like this movie only because of that anyhow 
This is the worst , and I mean THE worst computers based movie I have ever seen The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity br br I mean br br The guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person Now you probably think this must be some super cool high tech computer , well , it is , but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface br br and the main idea how to overload the super computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid My mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games br br there are also some other bad things about it but I just do n't have time for this br br I just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits Hah what good bits \? the only bit that was worth it was the ending \( those who have seen the film will know what i mean \) I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs Jason but what i got was this crap Story was forgettable , the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A , I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed Do n't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE 
Slim Slam Slum is a sad and disappointing picture There is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture Don`t go there , what ever you do , don`t Watch TV Shop for 10 hours straight instead That way you will be slightly amused 
I had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD Attack Force Now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me I bought this film thinking I 'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up br br Did i hell Segal is old and bloated , the plot was ludicrous even by SS standards and to cap it all off Segal 's acting \( such as it was to start with \) is exceptionally dire So dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded NOTHING LIKE HIM Either SS cant act no more \( a moot point \) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they could n't record the sound properly The voice would flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who does voice overs for Honda adverts ! br br Plot wise is n't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one , nothing new there The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away br br Avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu br br Utter garbage br br 1 10 br br This has been a public health warning 
I really wanted to like this film , but so much of it is stolen borrowed from other work some of the borrowing is painfully blatant The New York Times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers' cartoon \( 'Hello my baby , hello my darlin' , hello my ragtime gal ' \) But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox Blue Sky animated feature Robots \( 2005 \) and not find ridiculous similarities in storyline A young inventor growing up , and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions br br cityscape Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments br br robots The servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to those in Robots , and both films use a sort of retro futuristic look br br All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from Disney at the end , implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back \( which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other , with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity \) br br The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own , and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction , as though we do n't have the attention span for anything less br br The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated , and he 's a pleasure to watch Much of the rest of the film seems thrown together Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid 90s br br The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short By the end of this cartoon , we are reminded that Disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue 
The scenery is pretty and the dog is cute Other than that , this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it Jack Warden is pleasantly genial as usual , but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly The plot makes no sense , the dialogue is dumb , and there are numerous smaller faults But the dog is cute 
Friday the 13th step over ! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there I won this movie in a contest at college , and it was a waste of money even if it was free Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me I 'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again 
This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series br br Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap br br The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it Thats basiclly the idea every episode The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god \( which is quite right since he 's her mind control slave \) But this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort 
With this film , Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film 's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity' Obviously , it is not For one reason , many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set ups \( when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff , you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen ! \) For another , his concealing of one important information the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film That is , goitre , a sickness caused by lack of iodine \( salt \) This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research \( heck , if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he 'd have found 'goitre' \) he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people \( still , doubtfully \) Instead , with his film , he judges them constantly , talking about them as 'cretins' , again and again , dramatizing the action , setting up scenes to create the spectacle , all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all mighty objectivity Bunuel talks all the time in this film , not letting one word to the people he is filming He talks FOR them and , even then , JUDGES them This piece is flawed to it 's roots , to it 's ideology and it 's a real shame it 's considered a great film 
This is a kind of genre thing , meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you do n't If you do , you 'll love this Personally , I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers , and Eleanor Powell , Bill Robinson , Ruby Keeler , James Cagney , Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s , the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off br br This film is a case in point The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me By then , the story did n't have much appeal , either The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus I do n't think I 've seen a movie she starred in that I liked , including this one , where the goody two shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam \( I which she had ! \) br br However , divorcing myself from likes and dislikes , there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks , particularly those who liked The Sound Of Music a decade later There are similarities in the R H musicals Thus , if you liked the Julie Andrews flick , you should like this , too br br This is a Lavish production with , yes , a capital L This is the kind of big production musicals you rarely saw after that generation You also get the dubbed singers , unlike today , where the actress is n't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr , as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady br br Yul Brynner is King Mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist , the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way He is n't progressive , as the left wingers like the say , but the education teacher \( Kerr , as Anna Leonowens \) will set him straight Secular progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer ! However , Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more bark than bite character Justifiably , he is the big star of this film Brynner had magnetism Even in The Magnificent Seven , Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience br br In summary , it 's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it I 'll leave it at that 
Well , I can once and for all put an end to the question 'What is the worst movie ever made ever \? ' It is Flight of Fury , starring and co written by Steven Seagal Sure there are lots of famously bad movies , but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously br br It is a Romanian made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry , knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again br br It was released only on video \( I ca n't imagine why \) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD 's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling 
Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time Meet Me in St Louis , The Bad and the Beautiful I awaited this movie with great interest But what a disappointment br br Some Came Running is scene after scene of go nowhere fatalism Sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens The sequence is intended to be tension filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he does n't notice the scene is a wheezing clich and the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly developed we do n't particularly care that they get shot \( especially MacClane \) But that 's the only real cinematography in the project Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours Hell IS other people , apparently br br There is nothing going on in this movie The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in 'The Best Years of Our Lives ' And either of two Inge products , 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead end town , with much more poignance 
Unfortunately , this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original Nicholas Cage , fairly wooden as far as actors go , imbues the screen with a range of skill from , non plussed to over the top The supporting cast is no better br br The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold It turns out it 's just a bill of poor goods Disbelief cannot be suspended , nor can a befit of a doubt be given The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual , as the medium requires , and whomever scouted the location should be commended br br There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos , literally , at the end br br Disappointed ! Wait for the original to come on television , pour a whiskey and enjoy 
There 's no getting around it this movie is terrible I 've seen the old Christopher Lee Fu Manchu movies , I'm familiar with the characters and it 's serial origins , but it 's still just godawful However , Peter Sellers' genius still shines through with his portrayal of Nayland Smith , with echoes of sadness , tragedy , and strength simmering through a stoic facade it 's a performance I place on par with Peter Cushing 's portrayal of Van Helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Cushing 's Dracula movies If the movie was done in a more serio comic vein like BUBBA HO TEP by way of the 1960 's AVENGERS TV show , this could 've been something special If you 're a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completest , this is something you need to see , but it 's a pass for anyone else 
This movie is just so awful So bad that I ca n't bear to expend anything other than just a few words Avoid this movie at all costs , it is terrible br br None of the details of the crimes are re enacted correctly Lots of slaughterhouse footage Weird cuts and edits No continuity to the plot The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen br br This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it 's content The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky It looks as if it was shot on video br br In fact , now that they 've got Dennis Rader with life in prison , I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well br br Seriously , do n't even think about watching this one I 'd give it a negative star if I could 
Why \? Why did they make this movie \? If Timothy Olyphant was n't shirtless in it several times , there would be ABSOLUTELY no reason to watch this movie , ever Um Plot \?

This Tim Burton remake of the original Planet of the Apes from 1968 \( and starring Charleton Heston \) is a far , far cry from the quality and plot of the original br br Certainly special effects have improved since 1968 , but writing has not The characters were boring and the dialog was awful I sat through the entire film with a friend \( who thankfully only rented it \) and completely understood why , before Christmas , all of the Planet of the Apes toys at Target were in the clearance bin br br My advice to Tim Burton do n't put this on your resume br br My advice to everyone else watch the original 1968 Planet of the Apes movie 
Medellin is a fabulous place to live , work , and study I 've been there twice , and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities , paramilitaries taking tourists hostage , or anything of the sort There are invisible police , but it is not a Big Brother system There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life , but they do not hassle someone without good reasons br br La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra , and when a character dies , there is genuine pathos It is difficult to imagine , however , that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro , a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country br br La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia there are , of course , things to be wary of such as petty crime , but when one considers pickpocketing happens in modern cities such as London , New York , or Tokyo , Colombia does n't seem that different after all Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war torn country is now prospering more than ever 
I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further br br Nothing about this film worked , absolutely nothing Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex jailbird At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her Then there 's Delmar 's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict , Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends , one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life , death , grief and love in the first half , the film simply loses direction br br If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed For instance , why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money , especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife \? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly does n't love her \? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight \? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems , or is Missy the exception \? Has Delmar and Jethro 's mother always been on the eccentric side , or is it a more recent development \? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room \? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car , a relatively minor crime \? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex \? br br These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script Big mistake Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story , which adds nothing to the overall film , would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar , Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else br br Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all , including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material I'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director 's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story 
Julia \( Kristina Copeland \) travels with her husband Steven Harris \( Steven Man \) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island , an island of their own The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island While waiting for the boat , Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor , and when her brother Peter \( Brendan Beiser \) arrives , he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off however , he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage 's family , but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal Later , the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son The Young family does not accept the trade , and they initiate a deadly war between families br br Savage Island is a very low budget movie , with a stupid screenplay , amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting The flawed story is totally absurd , and there are many unbelievable situations For example , how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family \? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter Then the Young family vanishes Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends , and nobody chases them \? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are The good cast deserved a better material to work My vote is four br br Title \( Brazil \) Ilha de Sangue \( Island of Blood \) 
St Elmo 's Fire has no bearing on life after university at all \( for the majority of us common folk anyway \) Why was this garbage even made \? Who can really relate to this \? Who lives like these characters \? I truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script There are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere It must have just been one whole joke to them on set br br I actually found this film insulting to my intelligence The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released br br Do n't make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80 's films It really is that offensive to the genre 
What seemed as a good premise for a movie unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level Very hard to follow at the start of the movie I actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semi subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story It really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it 
I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of After seeing both this and Werewolf and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are , I became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here Alot of people are saying that people who hate it are only scared by gore , Do n't know good horror or stuff like that Well , I do n't really care for gore , but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie ! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around ! Or walking around the house garden ! A movie requires something to give it atmosphoere , you do n't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares Oh , and Makes you think \? Yeah , I was thinking MOVE ! YOU 0 ! ! One of the worst horror movie I have ever scene ! br br P s For the record , I am a big fan of the old style of horror , Dracula , Frankenstein , That kind of stuff 
As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan , I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me , but there is absolutely no reason for this br br Rated Super Action in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded Restricted Viewing Sticker I'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker \( HA ! \) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 50 from one unsuspecting person br br Shame on you Robert Napton ! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in American cinema You are a disgrace ! br br There is n't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action Did you use snot on these people \? Oh , look , they 're having a rave in a field ! Like all 6 of them And is n't that an Asian guy in the background \? Why is it always daytime \? Why did it take 1 2 of the movie to show anything and more importantly why did we watch the other 1 2 \? br br PS You owe me 4 50 
I saw this film at its New York 's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore Although it was funny in some places , the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden , especially the Lovely Lady and the voice of the narrator \( whom I have never heard of \) had a lot to be desired J C Mac was , I felt , the redeeming feature of this film , true action and grit and \( out of the cast \) the only real acting I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing , this could have been a half decent film Let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release , or if you really want a copy , look in the bargain bin in Lidl 
I read the reviews before i watched this movie , and i did n't believe them I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average It was n't This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats The film contains bad acting , poor sound , poor confusing storyline , bad makeup and it bored me so much i turned it off even the nudity was rubbish ! Did they even have a budget for this film \? I do n't think they did You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood Avoid this trash I watched it on TV and felt riped off , so do n't spend anything on it The best part is probably the end 
This is the first time I have commented on a film because I felt that if the right person read it , they might wake up and do something about it Over the last few months , ABC Family began airing a new format of movies I have seen the last three and enjoyed them They were engaging and did the trick My wife likes these films I was looking forward to viewing See Jane Date The trailers looked and sounded great Unfortunately , this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project The year is 2003 , the source \( all bad \) , the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all It worked against it I work in the business of film and television I enjoy being entertained This is one instance where I kept thinking could it get any worse The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you would n't know it from this movie To add to the overall experience , the end left me shaking my head An advice to the executives at Disney , ABC , ABC Family and the producers Under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films They have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word contemporary , present day and current means when describing a romantic comedy There is a world passing you by All in all a huge disappointment from folks at Von Zerneck Sertner and ABC Family 
This movie blows let 's get that straight right now There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and acts in a similar manner I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he 's OK in this movie There were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache Let 's face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene But overall Do n't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success 
Unfortunately , one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering , silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate , clich d screenplay Hollow Man is a rather useless film br br Practically everything seen here has been done to death the characters , the idea and the action sequences \( especially the lift shaft ! \) with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects However , it is just the same special effect done over and over again , and by the end of the film that has been done to death also I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme , which is hardly original in itself , would be the basis of something newer and more interesting This is not so It is n't long before the film turns into an overly familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics the mound of clich s piles up so fast that it 's almost impressive br br On top of all this , Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best Good points might be a passable Jerry Goldsmith score \( but no competition for his better efforts \) , a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects I was tempted to give this film three out of ten , but the effects push Hollow Man 's merit up one notch br br 4 10
 Loonatics Unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones The Loony Tunes have many spin offs and different versions , some were good , others not very much But Loonatics it 's the worst The concept is stupid and derivative of shows as The Power Rangers and Teen Titans There was n't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic This show just does n't work This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this should n't have be nothing more than a bad joke Lame !

Back \( again \) in Scotland , Lassie is \( again \) on trial for her life Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master 's grave , she must be put to death , according to law Oddly , it is also explained that Lassie had no legal owner , which is , apparently , also against an old Scottish law If , after three days , no owner is located , dogs must be destroyed Edmund Gwenn \( as John Traill \) pleads Lassie 's case , which leads to an extended flashback , showing Lassie 's adoption by Donald Crisp \( as John Jock Gray \) br br Although it 's based on an interesting , original story \( Greyfriars Bobby \) , Challenge to Lassie revisits several earlier Lassie situations and , it does not improve upon them Comparatively speaking , this one is sloppy and unexciting and , it 's a disappointing follow up to The Sun Comes Up \( 1949 \) Geraldine Brooks \( as Susan Brown \) and several of the other performers may be charming , but ca n't elevate this one Little Jimmy Hawkins \( from It 's a Wonderful life \) is among the notable children supporting Lassie much later , he will grow up to marry Dark Shadows ' bewitching Angelique \( Lara Parker \) 
I felt asleep , watching it ! ! ! \( and I had tickets for the midnight premiere \) Any questions \? The most disturbing scene , as far as I can remember , was the techno dance i dont know what that was scene By the way what an ending ! \? 
It is only Robert De Niro film which I really hates It is stupid film with horrible acting \( of course not De Niro \) For me , Brian De Palma must do his mafia films as always like Scarface \( 1983 \) or The Untouchables \( 1987 \) I also loved De Palma 's Mission Impossible \( 1996 \) De Niro worked with Palma two different times too , Greetings and The Wedding Party I though that The Wedding Party was OK too \( I did n't watch Greetings \) br br Screenplay is really bad and unfunny There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a Be Black baby scene and also I do n't like the scene where a guy 's sexual organ appeared So , it is one of the worst film I have ever seen ! just worst I hate that 
This movie was , as Homer Simpson would have put it , more boring than church Maybe I do n't understand it well enough , and I thought it started out pretty well , but after \( START OF SPOILER \) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working sleeping with her boss it just started to drag , and I struggled to keep awake Again , maybe it symbolizes something , but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place \( END OF SPOILER \) In the end , I fail to see why others think it 's so great , as I found it extremely boring By the way , I did not watch this movie by my own free will , as I was required to see it for a Film class 
I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it was n't able to excite , really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that did n't redeem it I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end , the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose , if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate 's part , it may have worked Jeremy 's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it Such a shame Disappointing 
I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people The one who wrote the brilliant A Double Life and the funny Born Yesterday and co wrote such excellent screenplays as Adam 's Rib and Pat And Mike with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and or directed such tiresome , sad drivel as Bachelor Mother , Some Kind Of A Nut , and this The cast tries , but the script is so tired and clich d that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated The script sinks to it 's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen 's character tests Drivas 's character to make sure he 's not gay An ugly sequence , but sadly one which could easily play in a film today Ethnic jokes are now totally verboten , but fag jokes are still good , clean , family fun 
It was n't good The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories I had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new' personalities \( or lack thereof \) I seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was It was serious It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection br br The most disappointing part was the horrible songs not catchy , not amazing In the original Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun You remember them and want to sing them But the songs in this movie were n't creative in the least it 's as if they 're talking in a annoying sing song voice quite weakly , disappointing I do n't have that want to sing them feeling you normally get from a Disney movie br br It 's as if not one wanted to do this movie , so they barely made an effort this movie would needs a new story line , new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying look at me ! look at me ! I'm so annoying ! mentality of this generation of Disney ' \( 
I went to see this film with fairly low expectations , figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff Sadly , it was n't even that I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out I went with my two kids \( ages 10 and 13 \) and even they kept asking , How much longer \? After lasting until the end , I just kept wondering who would approve this script Even the reliable Fred Willard could n't save the trite dialogue , the state jokes , and the banal plot I 'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie \( I use the term loosely \) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class At the least , there are many books on directing , screen writing , and producing movies that would teach them something about structure , plot , dialogue and pacing 
This movie is absolutely pointless , one of the good esamples how Malcom McDowall never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange This one may be one of the worst though No story , crappy special effects , shot in 4 3 or even worse cropped on DVD , just avoid it 
I have just seen this movie and have not read the book The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject , evolution , sincronicity and your part in the world br br However , the movie 's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version The events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence , and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose br br Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves \( in Little Buddha \) \? Well , this is nothing like that br br Most scenes are poorly executed There are a lot of scenes that really do n't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere br br The better actors in this movie , namely Hector Elizondo , Joaquim de Almeida and J rgen Prochnow cannot save it The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie , and because they were paid more , but this does not work Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all br br J rgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy \( as always \) , but the script does not help him at all The scene where he first tries to convince John \( Matthew Settle \) to join him is just bad script The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed The flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented br br Overall this movie is a big waist of time , read the book ! I have not read it , but it is probably a billion times better than this , it has to be br br It is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb 
I 'll try to use words to describe this on br br I saw the original , which was good in its own way , but back then I should have feared a sequel br br And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up , but now that I 've seen it , I have to say , it 's even worse then I thought Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin br br Let 's start with the actors they are n't all that good , but it has to be said , some make heads turn by being just plain awful But what can an actor do with a script like this one It 's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed , any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that has n't been done before , fails miserably In a futile attempt to get it up to date , they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big brother' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original , but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad In conclusion , if you have nothing , and I mean nothing , to do go watch it , or play Frisbee with the DVD by yourself It 'll offer you the same amount of fun I promise
Considering the potential this move had , the reality was disappointing While it 's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie , even that could n't turn this around Most of the action was predictable The jokes were flat to mildly amusing And the characters were not very interesting I wanted to like this film , but it just never happened Ben Stiller was hilarious in There 's Something about Mary Here it looks like he 's just going thru the motions If they have to lift plot points from Friends , they should have known something was wrong The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet \) br br Watch 50 First Dates instead 
Nope , I am just not going to get with it here I refuse to go along with the program Do n't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over rated \? Look at the reader comments and their star ratings Most are 6 10 , 7 10 or better I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself , which is unique How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles \? I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation , expecting fireworks , and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag It looked great , but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending did n't do much to save it br br The film 's background story says it all Director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie , is informed the footage will not be appropriate , sets it aside , waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up , then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes , filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated , excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence That the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd , original and shocking in a deliberate , calculated manner goes without saying But we are n't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone , we must consider the entire film , and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie \? Or are they just enamored by it 's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it \? br br Perhaps it is an anti clerical agenda that appeals to them Hating the western religions of catholicism and Christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance Just today it was revealed that the BBC routinely skews their broadcasts with anti Christian anti Western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness You can say anything you want about the Bible , pedopheliac priests , the institutionalized cruelty of the church , and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball But say one negative thing about non westernized religions , and you are toast This movie was tailor made for such a sentiment , with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old French boys complete with inappropriate touching , fawning , fondling , fumbling , groping , and patting of the backsides Ewww br br And then there is the horse couplings , photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry Yes I understand the thematic relevance of the imagery large animal phallus 's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers but if I wanted to watch horses , you know , do it , I would like go live on a farm Having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom br br Is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants \? Probably , though I will grant the artistic execution of most of it , filmed in a kind of arty Euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a Monet painting , complete with a spanning arched bridge And the ending \( which even I managed to be surprised by \) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package But you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it That is n't fair , and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about Iwo Jima Whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes The problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it Oscars because of it 's noble message not because it is a particularly good or original movie br br While it may seem like an odd parallel , I see one with THE BEAST How can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating \? And who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film 's explosive set piece where Beauty and the Beast finally do the nasty \? Somehow I managed to miss both points , and am delighted that I have seen this film so that I can trash it as being what it really is 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy fartsy Euro Trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut , and a great ending It 's art for sure , but it sucks hard br br 3 10
That 's what the title should be , anyway br br This movie combines guns , explosives , and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie Let me make my point in a series of questions answers type deal br br What happens in the movie \? People die br br Is that it \? Yes br br What is the plot about \? What plot \? br br What is the point the movie is trying to make \? Killing is the only solution br br What are the characters like \? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities br br Is there anything good about this movie \? Yes I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it br br If you like constant killing and greed , then watch the movie If you happen to be repulsed by such low standard entertainment , then Made Men is not for you br br To sum it up , the plotline stinks , the characters are n't worth their while , the storyline is completely resistable , and nothing fits together br br This proves one thing the actors , directors , and whoever helped make this movie certainly are n't Made 
I like movies about UFOs , which is why I recently decided to rewatch EYES BEHIND THE STARS after seeing it when I was a kid back in the late 1970s And now I'm compelled to write a review about it because I'm afraid I 'll start forgetting everything about it FAST You see , even though EBTS ai n't bad , it 's VERY dull and nondescript The story is sorta interesting but flat The actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing The FX are terribly amateurish but I can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling , which , unfortunately , this one ai n't br br Also , there 's very little violence and there 's no nudity whatsoever , which makes this 1970s Italian sci fi opus a TRUE oddity , because if there 's one thing that distinguishes Italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade , it 's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them Oddly enough , because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements , EBTS stands out from the rest of the pact I do n't know if this can be seen as a compliment though Personally , I can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but I think EBTS NEEDED more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry And the special effects are n't that special br br The story itself is actually interesting It 's a combo of THE X FILES and Antonioni 's BLOWUP a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country The aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model , subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth The problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer 's apartment \( this taking place just before she 's to be abducted herself \) The man takes some of the negatives and leaves , with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives The whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives The majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue , in the spy vs spy variety The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war McGuffin But as dull as EYES BEHIND THE STARS is , it does resemble THE X FILES a LOT ! I wonder if Chris Carter saw this movie Anyway , the best thing in EBTS are the POV shots , which are creepy and effective But the rest is almost completely forgettable , including the goofy looking aliens br br Even though I 've been mostly negative about this film , I sorta cherish it nonetheless I still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when I saw it as a kid And I own the video The film could have been so much more if it had been done properly Oh well 
The funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of Jules Verne 's classic Journey to the Center of the Earth is Verne spinning in his grave The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with Journey to the Center of the Earth is the title Otherwise , everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching In fact , the director has written here at IMDb COM that he directed only eight minutes of Journey to the Center of the Earth and the studio tacked on part of Dollman helmer Albert Pyun 's sequel to his own Alien from L A with Kathy Ireland Evidently , the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations , they grafted Pyun 's sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande 's movie Please , do n't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage br br Unlike director Henry Levin 's period piece Journey to the Center of the Earth \( 1959 \) with James Mason and Pat Boone , Lemorande 's Journey to the Center of the Earth takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii Two fellows , a British nanny , and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence Richard \( Paul Carafotes of Blind Date \) and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan \( Ilan Mitchell Smith of Weird Science \) are going out to explore a cave The heroine , Crystina \( Nicola Cowper of Underworld \) , works for a domestic service called 'Nannies R Us ' Being a nanny has been Crystina 's life long dream , but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs Nevertheless , her sympathetic supervisor , Ms Ferry \( Lynda Marshall of Africa Express \) , sends her to Hawaii Crystina 's new client , rock star Billy Foul \( Jeremy Crutchley of Doomsday \) who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career , has a dog named Bernard Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard 's jeep You see , Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby Anyway , Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard br br After she catches up with them to get her dog , the cabbie cruises away and abandons her Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town , but he has other plans Unhappily , Crystina joins the guys and they get lost , and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis , a police state ruled by a dictator , at the center of the Earth The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera The ruler of Atlantis , General Rykov \( Janet Du Plessis of Operation Hit Squad \) , is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human , Wanda Saknussemm \( Kathy Ireland of Necessary Roughness \) , to visit Atlantis Predictably , General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails , and our heroes and heroine save the day br br Journey to the Center of the Earth is an abomination The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships Albert Pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors , but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga 
The Omega Code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency There was a bit \( but precious little \) of good acting , primarily by the two prophets and Rostenberg , who only appeared once and had no lines Otherwise the acting was decidedly bad The plot line was rather weak , and only partially based on already questionable Biblical interpretation Certainly not one of the year 's best 
I ca n't say this is the worst movie ever made , but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters , \( 1 \) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it , and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets , and \( 2 \) it 's still the only serious film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through Once we reached the infamous \( and interminable \) snake fight scene , I think everyone gave up br br The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting Oh , and there 's also Bo 's breasts , although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and does n't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial br br The dramatic tension in this film is between Bo 's terrible acting and her husband 's horrible direction The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed However , this is one of those films that 's bad enough , it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor Definitely the worst film I ever paid to see 
Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn , I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead , of all movies Have n't seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say I made the wrong choice There is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut It did n't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend It simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect Get Wrong Turn instead , if you want to see Dushku I would like to see a movie with her and the super hot Elisabeth Harnois but I do n't think even that would have made this movie watchable Casey Affleck , so promising in Good Will Hunting , is awful here he seems to lack both intelligence and guts That 's enough on this one 
86 wasted minutes of my life I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it , and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema br br I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner , and can only surmise that the actors were as hard up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself br br Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted And if it is n't the wooden acting , almost as though you can see the teleprompter , then the set itself , which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways , and overdressed to an unimaginable extent , is enough to put you off the entire farce br br As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise , any person who does not see that as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot telegraphed light years in advance , should check their eyesight immediately br br Bad acting , and from two very decent actors , coupled with the hyper coddled Branagh trademark overdirection , is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself br br On top of it all , there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this , heightened towards the end of it All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people sha n't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again 
Surely one of the most ill advised remakes of a classic in film history especially since the promise of its tag line , The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time , isn t even properly exploited ! Although this film was regularly shown on TV in my neck of the woods since my childhood days , its notoriety \( for awfulness not erotic content , mind you \) kept me away from it until now and I only relented because I have recently enjoyed Bo Derek s previous film , 10 \( 1979 \) , and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the Christmas period br br Lead actress producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl ish sexual innocent \( witness the inept banana scene \) and , as was to be expected , she is made to get her clothes off a few times but , as welcome as these scenes were , she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here Richard Harris , then , chews the scenery incessantly as Jane s obsessed explorer father , but John Philip Law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in Jane herself newcomer Miles O Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie , is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel \( which is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway ! \) and , furthermore , is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film s second half ! for the record , he later starred in two ATOR movies \( or would be CONAN imitators \) for Joe D Amato and the King Arthur era set , SWORD OF THE VALIANT \( 1984 \) br br When still an actor , director John Derek \( who also serves as his own cinematographer here \) had worked with some good film makers \( Cecil B De Mille , William Dieterle and Robert Rossen \) and a few great ones \( Otto Preminger , Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel \) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability appallingly pretentious at times \( witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence \) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions this was Derek s seventh film as a director \( and his second of four with wife Bo \) and , eventually , he would only get to make two more br br The film s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the Tarzan legend was tackled once more on film in GREYSTOKE THE LEGEND OF TARZAN , LORD OF THE APES \( which , surprisingly enough , I haven t watched myself yet \) a mere three years later ! ! Nominated for six Razzie Awards \( including John Derek , Richard Harris and Miles O Keeffe \) and winning one for Bo Derek herself , TARZAN , THE APE MAN was co written by Gary Goddard , the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a \( this time animated \) heroic figure , MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE \( 1987 \) which I will be revisiting presently as well \( yay \) ! Despite a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with around with an orang utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion , any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting Bo completely white and , fatally , John Derek s clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self titled movie ! ! 
From beginning to end , this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about NOTHING I have ever seen The characterizations and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller 's character are pure torture The racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche , yet director Pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important br br Maybe there 's some value for a MSFT3000 re playing of some of the scenes , such as Pacino getting in touch with his inner female , for goof value But , even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey 
For the life of me I ca n't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this The plot is tired , the acting is strained , the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the F word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let 's throw in another couple of F 's for good measure , that 's what the American public wants to hear' Gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part Forget this c p , rent 'Shrek and have a good laugh 
After too many bad memories , I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence I recently watched it again just to remind me why I 've always considered this the worst ST TNG episode \( with the exception of Shades of Gray , which barely counts as an episode at all \) br br I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red penciled by the author 's Writing 101 teacher SHOW , DON'T TELL ! From Deanna Troi 's pronouncement , and everyone else 's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming , dangerous rogue Okona is , to Guinan 's explanation about how funny her droid joke is \( it is n't \) , to the who cares resolution to the conflict , there is n't a plot point that is n't highlighted and triple underlined for our edification , and there ai n't a believable moment in any of it Unfortunately , Bill Campbell , a charming actor in other circumstances , is too puppy dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot On the other hand , it could be that no one short of John Barrowman \( Jack Harkness from Doctor Who \) could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role br br \( Zero points , by the way , to the Data subplot While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago , he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way \) br br On a good day , you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode Me , I 'd rather skip ahead to Time Squared or Q Who 
I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people Maggie Smith , a very young Bob Newhart and , of course , Peter Ustinov My disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film does n't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London Bluffing his way past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart , Ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist' part of the film To do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe And here is problem one His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid His lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras The second problem is the heist \( fraud really \) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as Ustinov 's ditsy next door neighbor secretary who just ca n't keep a job I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here , too composed , the part called for more of a wacky , physical comedian Furthermore , Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together , maybe it 's the age difference , but the later romantic relationship , as devoid of actual romance as it is , still comes off a little creepy Ustinov co wrote the script , and it was thought well of at the time , but I found it unfunny , meandering and a sad waste of a great cast 
Bah Another tired , desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed br br On the plus side , Toni Collette is superb as always \( being an actual actress , you see \) , and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes There are even a few genuinely funny lines , and the filmwork , score and editing is competent , apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion br br But , ah , but Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot , and they are almost all very clearly too old \( and in one case too young \) for their declared ages Worse , they are all speaking Austinese , that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that could n't be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen 's day \( think Yosemite Sam , I kid you not \) This is particularly sad , considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial Fakespearan that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs br br And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow She 's only ever played one character in her films , and she stays true to form here , running through her entire range \( smirking to sulking \) in the first ten minutes , then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers , nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart br br In short , there is very little reason to watch Emma It 's an amiable enough adaptation , but if you 're going to pack a film full of anacronisms \( i e an appalingly thin lead who ca n't shoot a bow or handle a period accent \) then you might as well do it properly , as with the vastly superior Clueless 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer 's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian , and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life Words can hardly express my disappointment This movie was disjointed it gave no background about his life , no historical context , and nothing about his great writings \( except a brief , passing reference to The Cost of Discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie \) Instead , we see him enjoying jazz \( apparently in the States \) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany Apparently to show his human side OK , I'm ready for the dramatic part The part where he stands up for his faith Instead of emphasizing that , we get a very badly acted romance with a 17 year old schoolgirl Whether or not that actually took place , it should not have been a major portion of the movie Now still waiting for the dramatic part , or some narration explaining what his writings were all about or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drum roll waiting waiting ZIP Nada This is the kind of movie that gives Christian Films a bad name All they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow , with some background even some voice overs , or flashbacks to him preaching from his works some narrative about who he was and where he had been But no this is what we got Hardly fitting for a hero of the Faith 
How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie Terrible script , with forced character quirks \( the brown sauce \) Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin The attitude of 'ah , it 's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same' Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences \( the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase \) And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney 's character A great actor forced to play this part that could 've been written by a five year old Cringeworthy stuff The best thing about this movie is Farrell , and it 's a bad when you have to say that Well , at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful American accent International Audiences be warned stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock You 'll have a better time Intermission is a walk outer
Though I never like to be the sort of person who negates another 's personal taste if you like something , that 's fine But , this movie was horrible and there is no way around it I do n't like Ani Difranco too much , but she 's a great guitarist and songwriter , that I can admit But I ca n't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film Many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face Maybe , but everything is portrayed too far fetched There seems to be an attempt at a Naked Gun esque kind of comedy , but the timing is off there is too much space between each actors line , as if they 're holding for laughter \( there was n't any \) Whoever wrote the script was all over the place They tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film , almost never fully developing any of them \( especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher \) I did not laugh once throughout this entire movie I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen 
Yeah , Madsen 's character whilst talking to the woman from the TV station is right the LAPD IS a corrupt , violent and racist police And this movie changes nothing about it Okay , here are the good cops , the moral cops , even a black one , whow , a Christian , a martyr But this is a fairy tale , admit it Reality is not like that And most important for the action fans The shoot out is boring It 's just shooting and shooting and shooting Nothing more Play Counter Strike , then you will at least have something to do The only moral of this film is The LAPD is good now No more bad cops in it If you like uncritical , euphemistic commercials for police and military service , watch this movie It 's the longest commercial I 've ever seen \( 2 Points for camera and editing \) 
The real irony is this Joe Besser was a top notch comedian , in other situations away from the Stooges He had a definite track record for being very funny and clever Moe and Larry and Shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work So what on Earth was going on when he joined the troop as the third stooge \? Obviously , nothing In most of these late Stooge era shorts , more often than not , the boys are pitted against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not accurate Stooge etiquette One for all , all for one , every man for himself , to quote Curly from Restless Knights One thing about a good comedy team , Laurel Hardy , Abbott Costello , The Marx Brothers , no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around , when the chips are actually down , they stick together and come to each other 's aid In this particular one , none of that happens It 's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty , and not for comedic effect either One might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here , art imitates life Maybe there really was hence why Besser did not stay very long with Moe and Larry Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong 
I sat through almost one episode of this series and just could n't take anymore It felt as though I 'd watched dozens of episodes already , and then it hit me There 's nothing new here ! I 've heard that joke on Seinfeld , I saw someone fall like that on friends , an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline , ect None of the actors are interesting here either ! Some were good on other shows \( not here \) , and others are new to a profession they should have never entered Avoid this stinker !

When I was a kid we always used to be babysat , and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema This is one of the films we watched This is one of the stupidest films I 've ever seen , I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film ! A martian is dropped on earth , turns into a human , befriends a human , and is trying everything he can to get back home But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors , Back to the Future 's Christopher Lloyd as the martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie But apart from that it 's complete crap Poor ! 
I absolutely hate this programme , what kind of people sit and watch this garbage \? \? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm well out of the room before it comes on Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless What happened to detective programmes with real mystery \? \? \? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago \? \? \? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this 
I'm a big fan of camp , but when every plot 'twist' is predictable and bad , while obviously not trying to be , even I lose interest I was going to rate this a 3 , but the ending dropped it a point easily Its only saving grace is that I hated other movies more Not enough beer in the world for this one 
I saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 \( back when the tickets actually sold for 1 \) This is the only film I have ever walked out on \( with my friend , while the idiocy that is the Laser Bra 2000 sketch was on screen \) Evidently , my and my friend 's reaction to the film was a common one It is not that I found the film offensive \( either as an 18 year old or now \) , but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny , devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a Ed Wood film watchable This is the real reason why NBC refused to air it , rather than a failure to comprehend Mr Mike 's vision \( unless , of course , his vision was to drive the film 's backers into bankruptcy \) br br I remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published 10 worst films of all time list It certainly makes mine You have been warned 
This movie should have NEVER been made From the poorly done animation , to the beyond bad acting I am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said Ok , looks good ! Lets do it ! I was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was At one point , which very may well have been the WORST point , a computer generated Saber Tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth uh , ooookkkk The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance The other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down Then , there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle which scares me for one sole reason Will there be a Part Two \? God , for the sake of humans everywhere I hope not br br This movie was pure garbage From the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending 
I cannot believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish The previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible Suranne Jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines , but most of the rest of the cast followed her example Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid , old stagers whose diction was exemplary Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible \? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on , and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them and us thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest The ending was a complete anti climax A complete dud 
I have this film out of the library right now and I have n't finished watching it It is so bad I am in disbelief Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then , although she 'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian ' This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film It 's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide br br There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest , palest shadow br br Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany 's' twenty years earlier \? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure do n't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you br br 'Reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down , I guess In this case , Audrey Hepburn 's chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star Here she has even lost her talent as a star If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period , like Ann Margret , had played the role , there would have been some life in it , even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloid level situations br br Hepburn was a great person , of course , greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being , and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors After this dreadful performance , she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves ' In 'They all Laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50 's Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad Hepburn does n't take it seriously at all , could n't be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky Her last really good work was in 'Two for the Road , ' perhaps her most perfect , if possibly not her best in many ways br br And that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening John Ritter is horrible , there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see Dorothy Stratten , who was truly pretty Otherwise , critic David Thomson 's oft used phrase 'losing his her talent' never has made more sense br br Ben Gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then , and so we have 2 films with Gazarra and Hepburn who could ask for anything less \? Sandra Dee 's last , pitiful film 'Lost , ' from 2 years later , a low budget nothing , had more to it than this At least Ms Dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 , Audrey Hepburn 's accent just sounded silly she 'd go on to do the PBS 'Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what I like most is when flowers go back to nature ! ' as in naturalized daffodils , but in an actual fictional movie , she just sounds ridiculous br br To think that 'Breakfast at Tiffany 's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with Audrey Hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'My Fair Lady' , matching Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in 'Last Year at Marienbad ' And then this ! And her final brief role as the angel 'Hap' in the Spielberg film 'Always' was just more of the lady stuff corny , witless and stifling br br I went to her memorial service at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church , a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the Shaker hymn 'Simple Gifts ' The only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of Hepburn 's singing 'Moon River' on the fire escape in 'Breakfast at Tiffany 's , ' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation br br A great lady who was once a fine actress \( as in 'The Nun 's Story' \) and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50 's and 60 's who became a truly bad one that 's not all that common And perhaps it is only a great human being who , in making such things as film performances trivial , nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance Most of the talk about Hepburn 's miscasting is about 'My Fair Lady ' But the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'Wait Until Dark , ' which had starred Lee Remick on Broadway Never as celebrated as Hepburn , she was a better actress in many ways \( Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid \) , although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part After that , all of her acting went downhill 
An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus \( but done several times by now \) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit The editing could have been tighter I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits Maybe the movie was rushed to market The lighting was too dark in places But the worst technical problem is the audio The level was good enough to hear the dialog , but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them , which is very distracting Either they were not careful in the recording , or the sound mixing could have been better Also too much background noise got through The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter br br Also the acting was a bit flat I am sorry , but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie , in my experience it is a red flag br br But it was a good effort so I gave it a 4 
Dieter Bohlen , Germany 's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like You 're my heart , you 're my soul felt the need to tell his story and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer The result was a funny book about his life Well , more or less a fuzzy image of it He did n't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of American Idol especially his unforgettable comments br br This should be the end of the story really In the hype of the mentioned Idol TV show called Deutschland sucht den Superstar \( abbreviated DSDS \) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book The result is Dieter der Film br br I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely None of the gags really hits the point Naddel 's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona 's voice should have done that more Obvious , childish , predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen 's sloppy idealized memory They could have used this freedom to do almost everything It was supposed to be a satire , but they failed The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all br br It 's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success With the friendly help of Germany 's biggest yellow press newspaper BILD and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show Wetten dass \? is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television unfortunately br br Watching this movie is a waste of time there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at br br Therefore 2 10

I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70 's , when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in video It looks like a bad soap opera , and that is paying it a compliment Some of the actors give it their best shot Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do , which is to act like a sex addict out of control I ca n't say that it is pleasant to watch br br Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film , with very little variation in camera angles I ca n't fault her for someone else 's poor blocking , but she is totally unbelievable in her role Her little girl voice works against her here And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan She is certainly ageless and exotic , but she 's outside her range with this br br Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew \? br br Finally , Rosanna Arquette as the sweet , maligned wife comes off okay , and probably the most believable of the bunch But that is not saying much br br This has to be the worst film I have seen in years 
I saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf And before i got my first VCR I figured I 'd christen it with this little gem and it 's bad film making at it 's finest ! br br The dialog is inadvertently hilarious And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump Anthony Quinn is in it inexplicably And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years This movie is Mr Quinn 's Country Bears br br It features lines like , Shut up and let me FIGHT ! ! ! br br And You 're saying a lot of sh it ! br br And the priceless comeback Unfortunately it is sh it , tough angry sh it ! br br You 'll be awed by a fight scene as Bo does a SOMMERSAULT across a billiard table ! And does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll ! Chop socky action and T and A thrills ! ! ! br br What schlock movie fan could ask for more \? Oh , and when Mr Quinn 's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness \? He says , Real men do n't eat quiche br br Uh , aaa , yeah If Bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there ! 
The first Home Alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90 's The second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes ! Now comes Home Alone 3 I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering Kevin would 've been 17 by 1997 He could take care of himself , right \? So , what does the director decide to do \? He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick The kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house \? What kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots \? I do n't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie But please , I 'd recommend that you 'd stay away from it It 's not worth your precious time Go fold a piece of paper , do chores , balance a pencil on your nose , or take a nap ! It 's better to do then to watch Home Alone 3 ! br br 1 10
 Cavemen exceeded my expectations , and not in a good way It was even worse than I thought it would be Basically , here 's the show The Cavemen are an alternate race , they face prejudice , etc Quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created almost being worthy of jail time for the writers One show featured the cavemen going into a club , trying to pick up girls , and then nothing else happened It was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialog , followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals For those who have not seen this show , here 's an example of the dialog You 're sure you 're okay with going out with a caveman Yeah , that 's fine I 've had like 10 thousand ! Hilarious Possibly the best writing I 've ever witnessed br br 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup , tackling tough social issues Sounds like an entertaining night I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they 're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials I wonder if they 'll do the Gecko next , so that I can have a new title for the worst show I 've ever seen I would even say that this is worse than Viva Laughlin At least Viva Laughlin was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired br br Shows like this make me hope that there 's a comet up there somewhere aimed for Earth br br \( Unratable honestly \) 
I just saw this movie , and I have to say that it was a big waste of time The girl who played Eva \( Ellen Fjaestad \) ca n't act at all She read her lines very un naturally , and she had a very un natural facial expression through the entire movie Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand , is a natural She played her part with great perfection br br SPOILERS ! The story was simple we 've seen it many , many times before She breaks up , he finds another , she get jealous , he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end There were no surprises at all , one knew that Eva would break up , and that Adam would hook up with Petra The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party She became all serious , which is a side of Petra the viewers had n't seen earlier in the movie , and told him to win Eva 's heart back , which was really cute br br Besides Rosanna Munter , there is n't a single actor who gives a memorable performance br br This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors , so I do n't recommend it ! 
I'm a big mark for the music of Neil Young , and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt indie press circles , hit the first showing of Greendale I could find My excitement was short lived , as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed br br Neil says the film started as a soundtrack , and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack Not the best way to craft a story No character really has an arc , and when significant events do happen , the viewer does n't cared , because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point The film is all song , and to that end , the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they 're sung the technique works for the first stanza it is done , and is grating on the nerves after that It does n't feel real or fake , it just feels unwelcome br br Terrible acting , with characters finding one mood and playing all of it Poor lighting at times The only kudos I can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast , but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it An alright soundtrack , but nothing I'm quick to buy A bad film 
An actor asks , What 's my motivation \? , to understand his or her character After viewing this this docudrama , this vague and haphazard farce , a viewer wonders what anyone 's motivation was br br This inept offspring of daytime T V \( the Oprah show \) missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore weighty issues br br Its characters were all shallow and superficial , its story line far less socially redeeming than a Simpsons episode It gratuitously portrayed investigating police as unprofessional and incompetent It failed to offer why the court might treat the main character , a female child molester , so differently than it would have a male perp br br Why did this unrepentant woman begin grooming her second grade student , beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class \? Why did the boy 's mother testify in her behalf \? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism , plus generational rationalization and greed The movie gave no hint of that br br Why was n't the viewer informed that the victim 's mother sold interview rights to print and television tabloids , parading her adolescent son on The Today Show \? That Mary Kay 's lawyer cashed in , she herself appealing a Son of Sam statute so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder \? br br Why was n't it explained that LeTourneau 's father was a former right wing Republican congressman , the 1972 American Independent Presidential candidate , the John Birch Society President \? In 1983 John Schmitz 's political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student , exposed only when that mistress sexually mutilated their infant son \? Yet Letourneau 's dad had removed his many kids from too liberal Catholic schools , fighting to keep all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education \? br br A month after her conditional release , again pregnant with the now 14 year old 's second daughter , Mary Kay received 7 1 2 years in prison for numerous probation violations A prophetic editorial regarding the sad affair then appeared in the Seattle Times At the end of two wretched hours , LeTourneau was led off to jail , and this salacious melange of made for TV seaminess was over , until casting begins br br Sure enough , 18 months later , filming of this travesty was underway 
As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an RPG You seriously thought they were gay \? Are you retarded \? If you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends They were n't gay lovers like your bitching about And to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period Back then , women did just prepare meals while the men fought Do you even know your history \? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day \? This game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it , and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story 
Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting , this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia I ca n't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie 
One of the most boring slashers ever If you can even call it that I would n't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie , which it completely resembles The fact that you 're watching a small group of middle aged people in the woods is really unbearable They made these kinds of movies for teens , so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep fest \? My favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it 's the only reason I chose to seek out this movie , which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack , you 'll realize that it belongs nowhere else So if you 're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods , I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror 
I wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film The only reason why I did n't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda The beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing br br The problem is with the rest of the picture Alice Faye comes off quite hollow Don Ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material , he comes off so terribly corny br br The plot is a real stiff here with Ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to Faye br br It seems that by playing the song and dance man , Ameche 's marriage gets a second change to reignite Some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts br br S Z Sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine Ditto for J Carrol Naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role br br This is a chica chica boom bomb of a film

For starters and for the record , the term Necromancy describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does NOT , in any way , relate to having sex with cadavers That is called necrophilia and , yes , I know it 's an obvious difference but I'm already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that I sport a perverted taste in movies ! This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy , in fact , and merely just qualifies as boring , inept and terribly bad Necromancy makes at least one top five ranking , namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made ! Now , director Bert I Gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces \( on his repertoire there are titles like Earth vs the Spider , King Dinosaur and Food of the Gods \) but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless , redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead , Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith , where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity , especially with the town 's patriarch and owner Mr Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious That 's another thing How can anybody own a town and everybody in it \? Either way , Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead Since many years already , Cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he 's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes I honestly do n't see the point of the whole movie It 's a blatant rip off of Rosemary 's Baby one of the alternate titles even is Rosemary 's Disciples but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief Why is n't anyone allowed to have children for as long as Cato 's son remains dead \? That 's just really selfish ! When , where and how did Lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead \? Necromancy definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments , but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget The grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy Orson Welles' performance undoubtedly the low point of his career is pitiable , and still it 's the best aspect about the entire movie 
Ouch ! This one was a bit painful to sit through It has a cute and amusing premise , but it all goes to hell from there Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying , and he does not disappoint in this one Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly , among others , played it way over the top I know that 's the way the parts were written , and it 's hard to blame actors , when the script and director have them do such schlock If you 're going to have outrageous characters , that 's OK , but you gotta have good material to make it work It did n't here Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible 
This thing is really awfull There s no charachter with weight , they re all floating around in the BG s The Motion Capture is a fine toy , but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film THE MACHINE CAN T DO ANYTHING WELL BY ITSELF If you see it as a bizarre film , you ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity IN A 3D MOVIE ! ! ! It s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics You need animators and 3D animators , not data entries whom know 3D programs Note the junctions , like the elbows , how they lost volume and get deformed The person who made the charachter design \( a very good one \) sufered for sure when he she watched them move , cos you can t say they come to life 
In a word , this film was boring It lacked life and spark A big problem is with the two leads Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever He was boring , and she was annoying br br The visuals were interesting , but they did n't enhance the scenes If anything , the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen None of the action sequences felt real , and hence , the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br The film had potential , but it needed a better script , better acting , and a better director I kept thinking during the film , you know , this movie would 've worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain , Karen Allen was Polly , and Steven Spielberg was the director br br Ignore the critical acclaims for this film The critics I think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels 
When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from Buffy , Xander , and figured ah how nice that he 's still making a living acting in movies Now a weird movie I can stand , given that it 's a good dose of weird like for example David Lynch movies , twin peaks , lost highway etc And you sort of have to be in the mood for one This one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory 's that make absolutely no sense I mean come on people Nazi 's who conspire with America to make an unholy trinity of evil powers \? I was surprised they did n't mention the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people Maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense , but seriously I do n't condone drugs like I do n't condone this movie It should be burned , shredded and forgotten just so good ol' Xander might get another acting job It was n't his acting though , that was alright , but the script just did n't make any sense Sorry 
Did the movie makers even preview this before they released it \? The script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation The beginning does n't clarify if its a prequel or not It starts with Superman 's beginnings on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie but does n't really alert the viewer of this VERY confusing ! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac He is portrayed as a potential home wrecker , a stalker , and someone who is clearly depressed and confused This type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero The ending is absolutely ridiculous Superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself I'm seriously waiting for a SNL skit where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says , The results are in in the case of the child , Superman , you ARE the father To sum up OK acting by this Superman and Kevin Spacey , but HORRIBLE script The movie is basically unwatchable 
I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne br br It is shallow , two dimensional , unaffecting and , hard to believe given the subject matter , boring The actors are passable , but they did n't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over intellectualised , you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all , told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards However , it does n't work as a popcorn film either Its pacing is too off kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner br br I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best I could have done with the material br br Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure , and equally so is the national response to him Possibly folk genius , possibly class warrior , possibly psychopath and probably all these things , he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years Once again , his story has failed miserably on the big screen br br Such is life 
Two houses , one street , one phone booth , one car , a girl next door , a boy next door and a zombie This list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie All you need is some blue light , ambient music and done Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy though ! br br I like to organize bad movie evenings from time to time The concept is really simple get some booze , get some film loving friends , and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer For such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best Laughs guaranteed ! br br The bizarre thing is , van Rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement To be a witness to this you 'll have to listen to the DVD 's commentary track Again disbelieve and laughs guaranteed ! 
DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands` It`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies I could mention but it never fufils its potential Imagine how good this could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers directing Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson br br Oh is Carter based on Jerry Springer \? Just curious because the catch phrase on Dr Elson`s show is look after each other and keep talking 
I am a huge Willem Dafoe fan , and really sought out this film \( I had to get a Region 5 Chinese DVD of it ! \) But , it is truly one of the worst that I 've seen in quite a while br br The acting \( except for Dafoe \) is horrible Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed this \( though he is n't credited as a director \) , and they have NO discernible talents for writing or directing \( Stick to acting Willem Giada get out of the business , PLEASE ! \) br br Absolutely nothing happens Except a series of completely unconvincing , totally without believable motivation , acts by these two people \( that just met \) in this house Colagrande 's sleepy , I could n't care less expression practically NEVER changes And the sex scenes are downright lame I actually cringed twice at one of them Yuck ! They 're definitely not the least bit erotic , and yet are the only time the film is n't putting you to sleep Then , it 's busy repulsing you br br Just awful 
At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 of IMDb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 I can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members br br They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters , those monkeys , just by random proddings at the keyboard , would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare However , I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time , you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10 br br I patiently watched the first half , foolishly assuming that the film would , on some level , develop either the plot or the characters , or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought Failing that , I was quite prepared to accept action , suspense , comedy , horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention Ultimately , I was disappointed and consequently , much of the second half was viewed at double speed as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption Sadly , there was none br br If The Choke , was put up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery , intrigue and unpredictability And speaking of cartoon characters , the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable \( at best \) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey 's portrayal of the freaky , death obsessed pseudo goth , London , being so bad I almost felt sorry for her br br I would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack , a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock , failed even to entertain , let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick 
It gets really bad The only half way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film There are context errors everywhere The acting is horrible , save Kirk The story is as holey as the grail , and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie , if it was n't already a corpse So all in all it 's a waste of your life I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale 
I could only get through about 25 mins of it Not one laugh in the 25 minutes I gave it , one of the most painful films I 've ever had to endure Chris Kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him Just a horrible movie 
This movie is horrible Everything in it has been done before There is nothing original I cannot stand when writers do n't come up with their own plots br br A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult Hmm , sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called Big What is even more annoying is Jennifer Garner 's acting She does n't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid br br From then on , you can guess the whole plot She gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her Wow , how awesome ! But , no her friend is bad and turns on her , trying to get her job But , of course , she wins in the end when she comes up with a great idea br br There 's also a dancing scene in the movie that I 've seen a thousand times before br br I hate this movie 
I did n't enjoy this film I thought the acting was n't very good and the story was boring A 20year old computer saving the day \? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched , even for a film I could n't figure out why they could n't just turn it off , why not take a sledgehammer to it br br Its a shame , but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film , it was n't If that is what you want to watch , do not watch this film ! br br Even if the old computer had n't have turned up to save day , this would still , in my opinion , be a very very cheesy flick 
This film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2 3 of the journey Sadly , the film ends up being too 'confused ' While I know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films I got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and I lost interest br br The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on We formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering br br In the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could 've been an enjoyable piece of escapism Here 's what 's concerning Joe Gavilan \( Harrison Ford \) at the end of the film br br 1 His real estate deals 2 His affair with a radio psychic 3 He 's being investigated by internal affairs 4 The homicide investigation br br If you add in Casey 's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father 's death Now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen The impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking br br As if a ridiculous chase sequence was n't bad enough , one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour , was n't bad enough , Joe Gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun All these extra curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught We already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension br br While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story , I wo n't This could 've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting Sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable br br While this will probably be better than the likes of The Hulk and Lara Croft II that still does n't make this film good I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money , I'm not sure if that 's true or not What is true is that to get great box office you do n't need a great movie or a great actor , this film has neither in its lead roles My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run 
I just could n't stop laughing ! ! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid ! But , never mind that , it is very entertaining ! In this film , you do n't need to pay attention to anything ! The acting is the same LAME ! The dinosaurs are the same RUBBER \( Oh , my I could see the stick that holds T Rex head for a moment \) The raptors are the same from the Carnosaur 2 , T Rex is also the same , but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten Action is fast , sometimes too fast , actually I talk about fast editing , they edited it so fast , so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs , but OOPPS ! to late , they are rubber ! Well , only things interesting here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel br br What can I say do n't rent it watch it on TV , with friends , it is much more entertaining ! 
I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts I must admit , I found it pretty decent until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying Logical problems br br 1 Her boyfriend , who seems to be a pretty fit dude , makes no sound while being killed Do n't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer \? br br 2 When the remark is made that the gym teacher is SOOOO in love with Lisa , I almost screamed at the screen When your best friend 's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER , you do n't make comments like that if you have half of a heart br br 3 As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead , would n't the smart thing to do be to get Donna , boyfriend , aunt , and uncle into a car and drive far , far away , then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out \? br br I could go on And on And on Basically , the plot was decent , the characters were n't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors br br HOWEVER br br This movie might be good for teenagers , or young couples just looking for a fun night out If you do n't consider all the goofs , it 's a mediocre film 
Do not be mistaken , this is neither a horror , nor really a film I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine br br Nothing happens You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist , a hint of surprise , a plot to emerge but no br br The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet do n't have the time to develop thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers before returning to an idyllic and playful \( bring on the teen rock montage \) state The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion' br br Their encounters with obstacles \( be they human or physical \) are brief , confusing and entirely pointless br br Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast Lou Taylor Pucci could n't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert br br Watch 'The Road' , watch '28 days Later' , watch day time TV anything but this I implore you Suffer the boredom , unlike you may be led to believe in the film , this film is no cure 
This is by far the worst movie I 've ever seen From the plot , though the shots , the special effects , the acting , and did I mentioned the plot \? Every single thing in it sucked ass ! br br This is a good example of what over doing means and I 'll try to explain br br I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you ca n't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end You sit mesmerized , not knowing who 's dead and who 's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you 're wrong and the movie ends leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes ! Something like Unbreakable or The Job if you know what I mean br br But Olga Levens , the writer of this junk , yes , Olga The writer , Director , Producer , Screenplay author , Caster , Production designer , Art Director , Costume Designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to Olga Levens from Levens Productions you ca n't go wrong \) br br Well this might come as a shocker but this time Olga over did this big time , jumping from scene to scene , from dreams to reality but wait ! this was all a dream after all or was it \? \? \? The picture fades and I realized none of this ever happened , the girl was all alone on the ship actually there was no ship no wait ! There 's the ship again , and the guys ! They 're alive !

Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me While the actors did a pretty good job , especially Smith , there just is n't a cure for a poor script once in production The movie really had a sequel kind of feel , playing off partial events of the first film The story was , in a word bad , at best It was n't thought out well , and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times br br In the first flick , the MIB Organization had a kind of elite force feel You had a few special agents , and it had a clandestine kind of feel to it In the sequel , the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe br br The movie was n't terrible or anything it just lacked the coolness \( for lack of a better phrase \) of the first movie A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second , and did n't really add any originality to the MIB Universe br br A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 films Was it decent \? Yeah Is it worthy of bearing it 's title \? Not really

My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared , so I assume it was rejected , even though it met all the usual guidelines br br I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes , particularly the performance of Jordi Moll , a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as Blow and The Alamo Leonor Watling is also quite good Unfortunately , everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful , melodramatic script There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art br br An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere , anytime 
Christopher Guest need not worry , his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG gamers The jokes are beyond lame Not enough substance to last the typical length of a \( particularly rancid \) SNL skit , much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel The great William Katt \( Greatest American Hero , House \) deserves much MUCH better One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that 's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I 'll save someone such a bad experience br br My Grade D br br DVD Extras 2 Audio commentaries 7 interviews with various cast members 4 deleted scenes theatrical trailer br br DVD Rom extras 2 Wallpapers br br Easter egg Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
My title just about sums this heap of crap up I should have taken a hint when I saw it was a Fred olen Ray movie but i thought 'HEY , IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN HIS USUAL RUBBISH' boy , was i wrong !

As a long time fan of all the Star Trek series , I found this a disappointing episode , and I wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring Will Riker 's exploits , both positive \( and largely romantic \) and negative \( lots of pain , and a crewmate 's death \) was a money saving device , as were many of their bottle shows \( episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise \) Diana Muldaur \( who also appeared at least twice on the original series \) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character , Dr Kate Pulaski Loyal viewers \( in the Star Trek world , is there any other kind \? \) also were shortchanged This was the last episode of second season thus , the season ended not with a bang but with a whimper 
This ranks as one of the worst movies I 've seen in years Besides Cuba and Angie , the acting is actually embarrassing Was n't Archer once a decent actress \? What happened to her \? The action is decent but completely implausible The make up is so bad it 's worth mentioning I mean , who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film Someone should tell the make up artist , and the DOP that you 're not supposed to actually see it The ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream br br Do n't waste your time or your money You 're better off just staring into space for 2 hours 
Let me give a quick summery of the film A rotten , rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam a rapping genie Like all genies , he grants 3 wishes but , being good natured , also helps Max with his personal life , as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime During all this , Kazaam raps from time to time , \( also showcasing Shaq 's dismal rap skills \) br br This movie proves what we all know Athletes need to stick to sports I admit that it never looked like an Oscar worthy movie , but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible The characters are either unlikable or stupid , the plot is not even worth mentioning , the dialog is a joke , and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem Hell , even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big \( no pun intended \) at the time I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws 
My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made Certainly in the top ten of those I 've watched all the way through At least Plan 9 was enjoyable br br I DID really enjoy Christine , The Dead Zone , Firestarter , Carrie , and some of his other films I did n't care much for Cujo \( only because the sound was so bad on versions I 've seen and I often could n't tell what people were saying \) , or Pet Sematary \( Pet Cemetery \) br br But this mess was a total mistake in every way possible The creatures themselves seemed designed by a 9 year old \( No offense to 9 year olds \) br br Even the one liners made us groan and were n't remotely amusing 
Miraculously , this is actually quite watchable I mean , it 's bad It 's really bad But whereas the original was so bad it 's ruining my life bad , this is so bad it 's mildly entertaining bad Right , that 's enough faint praise Production values are rotten across the board , the acting is excruciating and the Romero wannabe satire ca n't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it 's mocking Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges , virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires , bullets working against the zombies or not , zombies having the power of speech or not Gore is the draw , obviously , but the framework is so slapdash it 's annoying The dialogue sounds like it 's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals , and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero 's films It 's all topped off with a horrendous synth score Absolute rubbish 
It 's rare that I come across a film this awful , this annoying and this irritating It is without doubt one of the worst films I 've ever seen br br The plot , when it 's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing , is ludicrous Why did Domino become such a bad ass tough bitch \? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this traumatic event left her emotionally stunted , and hating everyone When the dialogue is not clich d or banal , it 's littered with laughable lines such as There are three kinds of people in this world the rich the poor and everyone else At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm Because of a confusing mobile phone call , instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number , they blow off his arm with a shotgun At another point , the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go ! \? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy br br Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess br br I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott 's previous films , True Romance being one , but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot 
 Indian burial ground If those three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing , look for a different neighborhood A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery and , after a l o o o ng hike , an ancient Indian burial ground Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead if you do n't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet It can do the same for dead people if you do n't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house br br Throw in a busy two lane blacktop , speeding big rigs , a well meaning \( if somewhat dim \) old neighbor , and one kid who really does n't get enough supervision , and I think you can figure out what happens from there an over the top , illogical mess , which , in all fairness , does offer up a few scares br br Well , there are worse Stephen King adaptations \( such as Maximum Overdrive , which King also directed \) But there are far better ones , too \( such as Salem 's Lot , The Dead Zone , and both versions of The Shining \)

I remember reading all the horrible , horrible reviews for this film when it came out I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks The only other movie to manage that is Gigli br br When the movie came out on DVD , I bought it to see how awful it was I could n't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible After seeing it , I can understand br br First off , let me say that this film is not without some cool shots There 's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun , which I thought was neat And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at but it gets old after the first time you see it br br Let me start with the worst thing in this movie Tara Reid If bad acting was a sin , then Hell would 've chucked Tara Reid right out since she 's so unbelievably awful in this movie it 's unthinkable And of all the roles , she plays a curator Now if she played a dumb , empty headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character Apparently , Uwe Boll did n't realize that , although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie , people would see it He just did n't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping \? I could n't tell br br Which brings me to my next complaint Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you 'll ever see in a movie I mean , I 'd give House of the Dead an F \( and I only do that for very few movies \) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk The movie starts off with a very , very long narration that causes immediate confusion \( and read by a horrible narrator \) and from there , the cuts are really , really dumb There 's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that 's been destroyed and the screen blackens out When it comes back , Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly , an entire army has joined them Huh \? br br And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie At one point , a team breaks through glass , but the glass breaks before they touch it Tara Reid 's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade , you can see her begin to get up br br As for the story I was really lost Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out It 's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes \( the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film \) that get , quite simply , BORING br br I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was I did n't laugh , but I still think it 's stupid Very , very , very stupid 
I'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie , but few minutes after it started , I wanted to leave the theater For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me , but then realized it 's a waste of time , there was just nothing there I stayed only because I had another show after it br br Design some designs where quite beautiful , mostly of the environment , but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design They look great while still on posters and screenshots , but not when they have to come to life ! They just did n't work , mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D , that would make you feel that the character is alive You need a lot of effort and knowledge \( hence money \) to create something that really feels like hair , skin , fabric , etc Those characters in the movie were made out of cloth , and that just did n't work ! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality , where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic It just did n't have the feel of a material , that dolls are made of \( that 's what those characters meant to be \) I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game I do n't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen , do n't know about you br br Animation was also a disgrace I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9 It was stiff , boring , almost lacked any imagination or mood It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw , and that does n't add to it any good br br And all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story , right \? ! That was not the case here Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie It was below any level It starts straight forward , it goes straight forward and it ends the same There is no twist , no surprise , no good dialogs , even no development We 've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and 9 is just one of them , and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie The characters do n't even have time to get into the story they are just there , showing themselves almost immediately , and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what 's going on It just did n't work There are also many repetitive action sequences , that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story br br Acting , sound and script oh my gosh , what can I tell , it was pathetic Bad story has a bad script , and except dialogs like No , do n't do it ! I will do it ! But you cannot do it alone ! We can do it together ! But there are rules ! But we have to save him ! etc etc and so on , and repeating itself all the time , so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs , there were those non stop Ahh and Ohhh and Ehh , and Oooh , and Whatchout , and Run ! and OhOhh ! that were following almost every jump , run , or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed br br Conclusion bad acting , bad animation , bad sound , bad story , bad script , bad characters , everything expected , no surprises , no twist , nothing Only some good designs are not worth the time BIG NO ! 
I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster Being an Adam Sandler fan at the time , I rented it HONESTLY I could only watch about 30 mins of it It was TERRIBLE Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public I honestly hope this movie goes OOP soon , and I hope it STAYS THAT WAY ! 
Having listened to and enjoyed Harvey Bernhard 's Omen II commentary I was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish It 's like a really bad TV movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote I think at the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted by what I can only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief And then my mouth was going up and down because I was laughing so much Dire I do n't know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines , I have made my point succinctly , there 's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage 
Just too many incidents of violence br br The film goes from one scene to another , and in nearly every one violence erupts br br Now I am not one who is shocked by violence , and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing But , please , not one after another My reaction was not shock or horror , it was Here we go again There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence , but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely , and could n't wait for the end br br If this is the best the film makers can do , they should find something else to do with their miserable lives , like making shoes or delivering mail 
I would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again The Prince of Annoying , Myles Berkowitz , has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo cool The only amusing thing in this whole mess is Mr Samaha 's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust It is choppy and badly done , in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny It is neither I seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film \( or tape \) , but this one qualifies for that distinction If a date suggests seeing this film , run 
Probably the worst film I 've ever seen , the acting and story were terrible and I almost fell asleep The only good actor was Colm Meaney I had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end , no emotion , no charisma nothing ! 
Well , what are the odds ! At the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago , a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster 's egg that has been lying there for over a thousand years , I suppose ! The Crater Lake Monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed , but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest Yes , this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing , but it 's also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it Half of the film at least revolves on the wacky adventures of Arnie and Mitch These two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake , but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait It is mostly during their prototypic Laurel Hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake Steve Hanson , the heroic but not exactly sharp Sheriff is on the case , but only if he 's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area Halfway through the film , there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process This textbook WTF moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country , like in New York City or something , and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at Crater Lake Only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in Hicksville and there 's an exhilarating chase through the woods , ending in the Dino 's hungry muzzle The absurd little details in The Crater Lake Monster are too numerous to mention ! For example , this is probably the only creature feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint AFTER they already spotted the actual monster The goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as I'm concerned It 's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it Night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight all during one and the same diurnal course ! The monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film , especially since it 's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects The cute critter is a Plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between Denver the Last Dinosaur and an alligator Crater Lake Monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that I can only encourage to track down ! The miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle \( and because basically , this IS a very bad film \) should be put into perspective , because I might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value 
This documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes The fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela , something even we venezuelans do n't know for sure br br There are ways of lying , and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge br br The venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences , and they take advantage of that For instance POSSIBLE SPOILERS they show pro Ch vez demonstrators shooting at an empty street \( what the hell they did that for \? \) in a way of saying they did n't kill anyone , but did n't bother showing the images we all saw here , of opposition demonstrators \( and a journalist \) falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street They ca n't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace , something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the President A few days after the coup , the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the National Assembly \( our Congress \) why did n't they act against the snipers and he said 'cause they were n't there to act against the president , is n't that a confession \? br br There is so much more , the fact that the highest rank military announced that Ch vez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because that 's politics and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ch vez' administration br br It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary , made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old Hugo Ch vez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs , when the truth is that 60 70 of people rejects his government , and that percentage includes the poor br br I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies br br Nazi propaganda has returned ! 
I went in to see D War on a whim and with very low expectations The movie failed to meet them br br I do n't mind stories that stretch credulity remember Reign of Fire \? but I do expect them to be internally consistent This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath , all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla br br A shape shifting mystic warrior from Korea , curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed 's excellent paranormal division which has gone unremarked up to this point Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims I never meant for this to happen A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who died like star crossed lovers Mystic pendants , faceless hordes of robotic soldiers \( that owe a lot to Peter Jackson 's orcs \) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it br br The dialogue is appalling , the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was , to be honest , tedious However , for me the crowning moment was at the end , after the finale , when the music for the closing credits was Arirang ! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing Ran with a karaoke rendition of My Way and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa br br In short , a self indulgent , lackluster collection of clich s and narrative non sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer or even a not so serious movie goer I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video , but I'm not even sure that it 's worth that much 
The first Matrix movie was lush with incredible character development , witty dialog , and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story These elements coupled by incredible special effects of the day presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time Enter Matrix Reloaded \( and its sequel , Revolutions \) The problem here is n't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue The brothers have taken well developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs The connection that was first established between viewers and on screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie br br To wit , Morpheus was developed as a charismatic , philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie , but here in Reloaded we 're presented by a different Morpheus who stands hard and hollow , reduced to corny one liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film This character just did n't feel the same , and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie br br The removal of 'Tank' was also a disappointment Tank 's involvement in the first film was minimal at best , but he played the role extremely well In Reloaded , we discover that Tank dies after the events in the first film , and he is replaced by a Jar Jar Binks stunt double that could n't act to save his live \( think stale box of Kellogg 's Corn Flakes \) His performance left me chuckling throughout , and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing There was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on screen or the delivery in the script was off in either case , the experience was humorous ! At times I felt embarrassed for the actor br br Even Neo 's Godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences The alleyway battle with the 200 Agent Smith clones was certainly exaggerated One must wonder , for a man so gifted as Neo that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless , frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend \( especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the Matrix certainly Neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker , and more efficiently \) Again , such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency , and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped In jest , our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly Sadly , for those expecting more of the same you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed br br However , if you take Reloaded as your standard , run of the mill action movie , and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already established character development from the first film , you should walk away feeling quite pleased 
As an Army veteran , I was deeply offended by this film In my opinion , it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon \( it was \) , it would have been better received But it was taken seriously my many people , especially overseas Silly as it sounds , wherever I went in Europe in the late 80 's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film Unrealistic \? Hmm , let 's see A monosyllabic , muscle bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW 's In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M 60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats And he never misses , running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm I could go on , but I'm getting a headache I gave this a 2 10 only because it 's slightly better than Rambo III 
 may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman , who found out where he and his new wife were staying , , and she killed the wife , , making it look like a murder rape br br in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in Wisconsin and moved to Minnesota br br last I heard she was in a mental institution , Security Prison br br she was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for her br br The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin , , , , , , , and the murder happened in Minnesota br br There even was a feature story in People magazine Spring of 1988 , I want to say on Page 39 I remember this as I was in college at the time , , and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital 
A pale shadow of a great musical , this movie suffers from the fact that the director , Richard Attenborough , completely misses the point of the musical , needlessly opens it up , and muddies the thrust of the play The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work Attenborough gives us a fresh faced cast of hopefuls , assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business , rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show , along with a couple of newcomers The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene , showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16 17 on the line \( depending on how you count Cassie , who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie \) Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly conceived film 
I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the New Year 's weekend As I was looking through the shelves , Severed spotted my eye , and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent B grade horror movie The cover looked fairly good The plot sounded semi interesting So I rented it What a mistake Do n't be fooled by the cover , which actually looks decent I'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired , ritualistic serial killer called The Head Hunter , who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city \( probably Los Angeles \) , and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder br br Story sound somewhat good \? Well , it is , and this movie could 've been halfway decent But good God , it was bad ! Almost everything about it was laughable The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge , outdated cell phone , and for whatever reason , she goes outside and talks to some guy Then , a shadow comes up behind them , hacks off his head , and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling \( for absolutely no reason \) while trying to dial 911 Sound ridiculous \? Yep , you bet it is The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHS quality camera , and I'm assuming it was The acting was mostly awful , and the special effects were far from believable And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone 's bathroom Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious , and it did n't hold my interest for very long , and I often found myself bored and tired , mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography The pacing was bad Everything was just bad br br Overall , Severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent B movie The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget , it could 've been alright But this movie fell flat on it 's face If you 're expecting something semi decent , you 'll be sorely disappointed Only recommended if you can tolerate D grade horror flicks Otherwise , you 'll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage It had a little potential , but it was beyond a mess 1 10 
Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew , they stop off at a store accidentally hit another car decide to just drive off leave it Soon after the other car forces them to stop a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out shouts at them , makes them take their clothes off makes them pee on them then randomly drives off Shaken shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost are low on gas br br Produced directed by Greg Swinson Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing Theissen responsible for the cinematography editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst , I mean I'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that 's worse Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film making decision taken here were deliberate to try provoke atmosphere , tension , realism suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I did n't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube even then it 's still slightly embarrassing a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb \( the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing they ca n't all be wrong , right \? \) it 's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it 's absolutely trashed by just about everyone the phrase 'the worst film I have ever seen' is used a few times to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things I have to agree with them The story is terrible , alright I suspect it 's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal \? There 's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen it just feels totally random It goes on for ages , the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who do n't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff screaming a lot Oh god the screaming , there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates annoys prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly Then there 's the real killer , the entire film is set shot within the confines of a mini van , seriously the camera never leaves this car as you can imagine it gets really boring , add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion br br On a technical level again I can see that the film making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it 's a visual medium I definitely do n't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk It really does look that amateurish that bad , it 's a complete eyesore I hated every moment of every second of it Just think The Blair Witch Project \( 1999 \) only ten times worse looking sounding you will be almost there There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally ca n't tell what 's going on or happening because of the camera work the almost pitch black grainy contrast levels The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood a stabbing at the end br br Low budget does n't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes , with a supposed budget of about 4 , 000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production that 's basically pretty much the entire budget right there , the locations The acting is pretty bad by the main cast , I just hated all the fake put on crying screaming that did n't convince at all but did irritate immensely br br Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen I have seen a few films , whenever anyone now ask 's me what 's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention I hated it , every single aspect wretched moment of it 
Let me start by saying that I totally agree with the basic thesis of the film , that there probably was no historical Jesus and Christianity is a sham With that said , this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis It makes good arguments the gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the Gospels , filled only by the writings of Paul , who does n't indicate a historical Jesus and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them It makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on , and it resolutely ignores counter arguments presented by Christian apologists The intellectual dishonesty , emotional manipulation , and lack of serious argument are obvious , and stunning The only Christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker 's old school who comes off like a reasonable , rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder and various Christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot I'm sorry , but revealing that average Christians do n't know much about their religion is n't exactly damning evidence of Christianity 's fraudulence You may as well claim that Jay Leno has disproved the existence of Michael Dukakis on his Jay Walking segment The interviews with experts can be interesting , but the film is filled with too much of , let 's be honest , the filmmaker just being snarky Within the first five minutes the film has already conflated Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the writers of the Left Behind series with the Branch Davidians And by the end , the film becomes so self centered that there 's no rational argument left , just an angry former Christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood Y'know , maybe that movie could 've been interesting , but it 's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of Jesus , and it 's so self congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy This is a Michael Moore film without the humor or the film making acumen combined with a Richard Dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor Skip it 
This film reminds me a lot of the anti drug films of the 50 's and 60 's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about Tom Hanks and his buddies are role playing , but there are no dice , lots of candles , and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the lady in the group quite funny but misguided I wonder how many poor kids had their D D stuff destroyed , and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction As a film it 's basically an after school special , bad acting \( although Hanks does show some of his talent \) and relationship talks , and no one seems to be having any fun It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism , which is more serious , apparently , and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does Despite my vote of 2 , this is worth watching due to its unique genre , scare films , which I personally find quite funny 
I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film the road side bar scene in Russia In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 Dollars you Drink and Talk , but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could , so I declined to take this speaking part on I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as I 'll be Back and Quite Frankly My Dear , I Do n't Give a Damn Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski br br As time goes on , I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film br br Even though I spent a whole day on the set , in South Wales hot spot Barry Island , no one could tell me what the actual storyline was The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if I 'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films br br Still On the positive side I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break I had no idea who he was , as Notting Hill was yet to be released , and not an inkling that he might be Welsh Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production 
This film ca n't make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or do n't ever go in the water again A fisherman \( Nolan \) is out to nab a killer whale , a very bad thing , but when he accidentally \( ACCIDENTALLY mark you \) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate , the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself \( I doubt it was her first \) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds , her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt , kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan Obviously as among humans , total psychos date other total psychos br br The film reeks of half thought out anti human message , the poor poor whale ! ! the evil men must suffer and die ! and yet , it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all It 's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel , but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and , as the film progresses , he grows more and more compassionate to the whale 's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale , just to make it feel a little better br br The films final journey , in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north , reminds me of Melville 's eerie man whale connection , and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion , where these two husbands might connect , understand even respect each other in their own grief , for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident It 's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss However , it never goes there The whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no doubt through an oversight , fails to chomp up the whale hugger \( tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier \) I love animals , and I detest whaling , and what is more I love orca whales , but if this film 's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed Nolan shows compassion and growth , and feels for others , and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming br br The only message one can walk away with is If you see an orca whale , ever , anywhere , run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way , he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you 
Might contain possible spoilers \( Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter \) br br Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion \? Sure it 's cheaper for them , but after a while , would n't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are The voices do n't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again \( Since when \? ! \) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films Even the movie 's musical number \( which had been Disney 's specialty for years \) stunk I would n't recommend this film to anyone even the very young All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released , it 's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality 
Wow what a great premise for a film Set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons Hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango Gosh I wish I had that knack for genius Yes I`m being sarcastic br br It amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made Come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan \( I do concede they do exist judging by the comments \) or a die hard member of the Sally Potter fan club \( \? \) there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it Even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road br br Coming soon THE REVIEW LESSON where a failed screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen Gasp in shock as Theo Robertson puts the boot into the latest Hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body THE REVIEW LESSON coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie br br PS Sally Potter is unrelated to Harry Potter
the author of the book , by the same title , should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book , this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details the movie adds nothing , in terms of artistic merit , to the book 's own literary achievement br br for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace , it does n't offer anything more while it is moving slowly \( like character development , for example \) some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie , but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle its fairly tame and not imaginative at all 
Being an Elvis fan , I ca n't understand how this proyect could be done Is by far the worst Elvis related movie of all time , totally unfunny , silly and plenty of mistakes about The King Come on , Elvis' grave in a public park \? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958 \? and these are just two examples Some people in the cast tries to do their best , Mike Starr is funny \( specially as an impersonator \) , the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise , but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks Overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute If you want to see an ultra cheap , insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis , I truly recommend you Bubba Ho Tep instead of this mess 
I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I 've gathered , it will be interesting \( when I finally do read it and I will \) My comments will be based purely on the film As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did , I was so disappointed it hurt This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish The actors were not well cast \( though Robards and Pryce are both good actors just not here \) The kid actors , it seemed , were merely asked to show up , get in the characters' clothes , say the lines and make the faces The set and props were cheap and unrealistic The direction was surprisingly bad I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it , just to see the kind of work he had done The editing was cut and paste and the plot \( screenplay \) was just that as well \( even though the author had been involved himself , irony \? \) The building up of the tension , fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came br br I 've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing It had so much potential Unfortunately , the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story 
 I thought I 'd be locked away in a padded cell and they 'd throw away the key \( Thus is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from State of Mind br br One wonders in what tangled forest Paula Milne and her co writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten , to create this feeble whodunnit and bring such rubbish to our screens A padded cell should indeed be left available br br Niamh Cusack did her best , \( as did the other actors \) but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this The height of absurdity has been reached , and this particular State of Mind is best buried and forgotten , and certainly not just placed in a box and locked away in a drawer 
I 've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons br br 1 \) This is , without doubt , the worst film i 've ever seen 2 \) Unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list which it deserves to be 3 \) I was kinda lucky i paid five pound for it i 've seen it in shops for 15 pound DON NOT PAY THAT MUCH FOR THIS FILM ! You will be very angry 4 \) There are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating \( in my opinion \) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal br br The plot summary a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world well , the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else Our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang sitting on swings , baby sitting He kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police br br Why is it so bad \? To begin with the acting is VERY VERY bad Someone else compared it to a school production No , this is worse than any acting i 've seen on a school stage br br I 've bought a number of these previously banned films from the DVD company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay , the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense What was the point in making this film when there is n't even any gore ! okay , no gore What else can a film like this offer \? Breats \? No , not even any titillation ! br br it 's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is , at best , worth only one out of ten 
There were some scary scenes , which I 've always liked more than straight out gore , but otherwise this movie was rather weak THere were too many questions left unanswered , and when they tried to explain anything in the movie , it was still rather unclear After watching this movie I still seemed lost in a lot of ways It sort of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back That movie was also unsatisfying , but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense This one , not so much br br The acting for the most part in the Abandoned was decent , but the movie dragged on an on , and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion Like I said above , there were some creepy scenes , but otherwise , this movie was a mess Sorry , I ca n't recommend it 
Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man , a poor man , without any moral qualities He only wanted to success in a society where all the people , the politic men , the businessmen , the journalists , the women are corrupt The only king is MONEY The Maupassant hero , Charles Forestier is going higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction poser He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the society stapes At the end of the novel , he married himself with the biggest daily paper owner 's daughter , in the greatest church of Paris La Madeleine Le Tout Paris is there He has a fortune and more , he will become a member of Parliament and later a Minister The useless women are out of his view , but he is always keeping in touch with the pretty and the usefull women The picture THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI is a story of MORALITY It is everything , but not a story in the Maupassant idea Why had they put BEL AMI in its title \? 
It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone , Brian DePalma , Al Pacino , and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable , trite , and pathetic pieces of film making of all time This movie represents the worst of Hollywood br br What is this \? Is it based on a true story Well , they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture kind of like Rocky on cocaine Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans \? For the life of me I do n't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie The accents are totally fake , and scene with Antonio 's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show Is this movie about Miami \? It looks more like L A transposed in Florida Afterall , a palm tree is a palm tree Is this a romance novel The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo , and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other Is this a drug movie \? Well , no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water Admittedly , the acting is terrible br br Let 's get to the rest The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show I think I heard a polka \? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective Clearly , the photography budget was excessive The sound is bleached in a number of spots , and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse The writing is appalling This is one of those movies were the script writes itself You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next , each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks br br So I am going to ask , Is this even a movie \? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours But at least a drama series has some kind of focus Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together Whatever it is , movie or not , it is a piece of crap 
Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 \( except for the R rating \) , there are very few things to like here One or two lines from Kenan Thompson , David Koechner \( we really should see him more \) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings , but sadly , that 's it Poor plot Poor acting Worse writing and delivery The special effects are dismal As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke , the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible If we consider the action portions , well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan This movie only contains the latter kind This leaves little left I'm so glad I did not pay for this br br Despite any hype , I can read and think , so as I sat down to watch , I did not expect anything good I had no expectations , but was somewhat worried going in Yet , like a train wreck , one cannot merely look away And even with no expectations , I was let down Bad Not even 'so bad , it 's good' material I'm very tolerant of bad movies , but this makes Six String Samurai \( which I liked \) Oscar worthy br br No , this piece of over CGI 'd rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth , Little Man and Gigli How this is currently rated a 7 2 completely mystifies me Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers br br I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight , I witnessed a train wreck I need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10
Scary , but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70 I saw this as a late night re run in about 1976 and thought it would never end Like crackers , it 's better than nothing \( but just \) br br Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks as if he 's been stuffed by a taxidermist Yvette Mimeux looks as if she 's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown br br It 's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary 's Baby This is one turkey that should never have been made If you have insomnia and it 's 1 30 on Saturday morning and there 's nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship , then I guess it beats that But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment 
I am terribly sorry , I know that Fa binder still is called one of the greatest directors in post war Germany and that most of his films are considered master pieces , but when I see Lili Marleen today , in 2004 , I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie ! The acting is simply terrible Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot ! , the changings between Nazi glamour and battlefields are ridiculous , the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art , but for me this movie is simply bad cheap Compare this to Viscontis La Caduta degli Dei and tell me again that Lili Marleen is a good movie 
What 's up with Robert Pretentious Altman \? Was he saving on lighting \? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable I mean , have you ever seen a lawyer 's office where everyone works by candlelight \? br br Do n't waste your time In fact , do n't waste your time with anything Altman makes It 's all a pretentious waste of film 
Alright , so I 've been dying to see this movie Stoked about the , who 's who in horror land that are in the film well , my friend rented this , brought it over , and we started watching it It 's supposed to be a comedy I did not smirk even ONCE , until the 40min mark br br Does it have to do with the budget \? Not at all , in fact , there 's films out there that cost CLOSE TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING , and they 're amazing \( to me anyways \) Also , while watching this film , I could n't help but realize the similarities \( i e , STEALING \) to a low budget indie film titled , ACTRESS APOCALYPSE , read my review about it \( it DESTROYS this film BTW \) br br This film it had potential it really did It had the star power , stolen plot \( lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie IE ACTRESS APOCALYPSE seriously , this angers me the more and more I think about \) , it really could 've been funny A LOT , A LOT of the jokes fall flat The acting is alright for what it is But it dragged on , was n't funny , and the plot was totally stolen br br I give this a two , because it was n't SOOO AWFUL , but that 's the ONLY reason 
Thomas Archer \( Ron Eldard \) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion Dr Heller \( Christopher Plummer \) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man \( Til Schweiger \) bound and gagged to a chair He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him And there 's a large assortment of instruments there to help him br br Film is interesting at first \( and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore \) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore How such talented actors like Eldard , Schweiger and Plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me This gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through 
Yep , the topic is a straight quote from the movie and I think it 's pretty accurate I was so bored to dead with this pointless effort All the flashes etc making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making If you are epileptic , you would have died at least five times already Of course all the David Lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it does n't make any sense AND when it does n't make any sense it 's got to be art , and art movie is always good Right \? I say WRONG This kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you 're a good film maker Anthony Hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting 
I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970 , but Return played like a typical sequel Everything about it budget , script , plot , casting , and acting was inferior to the original Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman , an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe , looks nothing like an Indian , and neither do half of the other Indians , who were played by Italians , Mexicans , and Latinos with cheap wigs And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors He even used the bow like a woman ! Finally , Richard Harris , who did such a superb job in the original , seems to be coasting this time around I guess he could n't resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse br br To be fair , there are some interesting moments in the movie , such as Horse 's undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors , but on the whole , Return is uneven , boring , corny , and predictable just like most sequels 
To be completely honest , I have n't seen that many western films but I 've seen enough to know what a good one is This by far the worst western on the planet today First off there black people in the wild west \? Come on ! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly , no no , completely retarded ! Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English \? If the setting is western , Asia is n't where your going Finally , the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning Now do n't get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so do n't get ticked after reading this but this movie , this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen ! 
I 've said this in other reviews , without a story , you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want , still no one will give a damn br br The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco \( which I love \) , and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making However , it 's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie , he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned plotted film \( SPOILER \) For crying out loud , they forgot to have a villain in this thing ! OK they have one , but he 's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain As far as action goes , well let 's see , Sky Captain \( Law \) shoots down ONE robot , two or three of the flapping wing airplanes \( before Dex \( Ribisi \) tells him to stop shooting them down ! ! ! \) , and a couple robots , but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie \( the reviewer who comments on hers and Law 's lack of chemistry is so right \) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera , showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT , both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie , one uncomically , one quite funny , although I saw it coming from 70 years away No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen , and that 's the movie 's real flaw An audience does n't identify with robots , they need a hero to root for , and a visible , despicable villain to hate Without that , plus a good engaging story , all the CG in the world wo n't help 
When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible , the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with , or the point is one not easily conveyed to film , or the movie missed the point , which is the most frequent of these results , and the easiest to happen , especially when the point is one not easily defined The book Morvern Callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this , and felt as if he had gotten it but I suspect most of them could not state it in words I'm not sure I can , myself , but perhaps it comes to this , or something like it Things come , things go , such is life , but we carry on or at any rate some of us people like Morvern do No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition But the important fact is that there is a point possibly the sum of the entire story is the point and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view , and to carry over , in adapting the story to film The maker of this film evidently missed the point , and does n't substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing br br This is not the usual complaint of a book lover that his favorite text has been violated The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance , and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half educated Morvern , but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect , as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone , as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance , despite Morvern 's own self characterization as a raver , am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working class Scots girl , and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past \? In any case , despite my irritation at the author , I could n't deny that his book stuck with me and what I could n't get out of my head was his character 's attitude , her angle on the world , which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait Morvern is the kind of person who 's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her , like flies , so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging through , unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical and that does n't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough The complex of incidents and of Morvern 's responses to them are the substance of the book , and its achievement , in exposing a cross section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book , I can see this br br The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie or if it is , most of her is kept offscreen An actress who might have been a good fit for the character , had she been the right age at the right time , is Angharad Rees , from the old TV series Poldark Samantha Morton , then , would seem like good casting she 's rather the same sort of actress , and in one of her earlier movies , Jesus' Son , she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one Unfortunately , as the film turned out , she does n't have the character from the book to play For one thing , the book is one that , if it is to be dramatized , virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments , her perspective , her voice , the story loses most of its meaning It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty , and so Morvern 's responses \( whether of amusement or distaste , depending on her mood \) are missing too , and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story In short , the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk , edgy serio comic novel into a genteel art TV film , and chose as her typical image one of Ms Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross This is n't at all what the book , or the Morvern of the book , was about For another thing , the Morvern of the movie is n't Scottish \( the actress said in an interview she had n't had time to study up the accent \) , and she ought to be it 's important that she , her family , and her mates are all from a single place And finally the film is missing the end of the story Morvern 's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it 's winter , the dam has frozen , the power has gone out , and the pub is dark Minus this , and minus all of the rest , what 's left is a failed art film , a dead film , about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal , or native inability , ever to give in to being dead 
Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , I really had no opinion of the man , save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist , although I could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings So , stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky Rebel Without A Pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 , I decided to get it , just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him While glad I got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about \? br br For a man with so many degrees , lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive' , by the New York Times , according to the DVD 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and I would n't even want to watch what a William F Buckley could do to him Granted , the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly But , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise \? Even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further insulate the man from reality , by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film , this much I knew he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the Soviet Empire The film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble His wife , Carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film She seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life The lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the Chomskys , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then br br Not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background It 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one Stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky , videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him This is really poor film making by director and editor Will Pascoe , who in the DVD 's Filmmaker Statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky 's Other than that , one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds br br Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky 's lectures at McMaster University , in Ontario , Canada , prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 , much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era Yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on American media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out cabals As example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled Similarly , he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result Of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when Castro and company were great sponsors of it , in Latin America , Asia , and Africa , until the Soviet Union fell I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho br br In his simpleminded world without grays , Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco , whom he reviles , are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals In short , Chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually Near this film 's end he warns , 'Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti intellectual their posit Please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , DVD 
I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it 's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies Although I tried , I just could not stand this movie at all , it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on Although I know it 's suppose to be a comedy but I did n't find it very funny It was also an especially unrealistic , and jaded portrayal of rural life In case this is what any of you think country life is like , it 's definitely not I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute , but the french guy was really fake I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story , but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it , it 's just too annoying 
Come on ! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies but can seriously affect a generation of viewers br br I am a HUGE Bollywood fan but anti Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay , cinematography , action sequences everything br br I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda , and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses 
but Cinderella gets my vote , not only for the worst of Disney 's princess movies , but for the worst movie the company made during Walt 's lifetime The music is genuinely pretty , and the story deserves to be called classic What fails in this movie are the characters , particularly the title character , who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the term br br After a brief prologue , the audience is introduced to Cinderella She is waking up in the morning and singing A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes This establishes her as an idealist \( and thus deserving of our sympathy \) Unfortunately , the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about Freedom from her servant role \? The respect of her step family \? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds \? In one song \( cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD \) Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently You go girlfriend ! In short , Cinderella is a very bland character She passively accepts her step family 's abuse , escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family For this , she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear , a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except , of course , Cinderella Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat \? If Cinderella is dull , her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time We are given no indication if he is a good man , if he respects Cinderella or anything All we know is 1 \) he is a prince and 2 \) he dances well Heck , even the prince from Snow White got to sing a romantic song at least Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting , it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot , weakening her already tenuous appeal br br Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were , the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie 's comic relief , Cinderella 's friends , the mice Granted , these characters are amusing Even so , when the comic relief steals the show from the principals , well , let 's just say your story has some problems br br Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces While many of them are , there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way Cinderella is a prime example of this fact 
Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for 2 I enjoy a good B movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one br br The movie is quite cliche 1970 's and is quite groovy for that Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie In fact , I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was br br The movie has good spots in it , but you have to wait and wait and wait for them br br If you are into B movies , this might just be for you , just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens , and did I mention not much story line either br br 
A painfully protracted , maudlin and predictable drama , my twenty fifth Sidney Lumet film , Garbo Talks , gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest br br The film documents a harried young working man named Gilbert \( Ron Silver \) , who is son to Estelle Rolle \( Anne Bancroft \) , eccentric , feisty and above all , an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo When Estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor , her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down Greta Garbo , and bring her to his mother br br Anne Bancroft is in full on , chew the scenery Auntie Mame mode here , that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves , where she mouths off to people , and stands up for her ideals , and ends up in jail all the time She stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct , and every scene with her is yuk yuk lame every note striking false The rest of the characters are equally as one dimensional , but tremendously less interesting Ron Silver is flat as can be , and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film He is dating affluent Lisa Rolfe \( Carrie Fisher \) , but becomes smitten with oddball co worker Jane Mortimer \( Catherine Hicks \) , and I called every scene three scenes before they happen br br That 's the other problem One dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story , but there 's simply nothing here The film 's pace is glacial , resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing , and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot , it 's both plodding and uninteresting There are plenty of guest stars , so to speak , including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker \( imagine that \) in yet another highly inessential scene br br Late in the film , it attempts to make a halfway decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives , but by that time , none of the characters exist as real people , and the film had bored me into submission , so it functions as a case of far too little , far too late The film is my twenty fifth Lumet directed film , making him easily my most viewed director , but outside of a couple egregious misses \( A Stranger Among Us , anyone \? \) , he has n't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks br br Grade 4 5 10 \( C C \) 21 \( of 24 \) of 1984 23 of 25 Lumet films 
CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it 's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO , UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the mid to late 60s br br In itself MATRON is by no means bad it 's just that we 've seen it all before with a thin plot \( A bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries \) surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature I think that 's where the problem lies The gags are n't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age Did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot \? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon , less that twelve hours ago and I have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line That 's a serious problem for a comedy
This is one lowly film It has no real plot We never are made privy to motivations , other than wealth The characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film The threat seems to be supernatural , but then it 's being controlled by these three older people Why are they doing what they are doing in order to strike fear into other members of the group \? I do n't know There is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it Does it do something \? I do n't know There 's some nudity for its own sake I'm always surprised to see this in films this old Things have actually settled down in this regard these days Anyway , the people run around like chickens , ready for the ax They have no plan no resources no nothing There are about five silly climaxes in the film Who are these people and is there a ghost or demon What happened to the other people \? I challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence What a mess 
There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not acknowledge this film It consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time The acting is horrible , the script lacks direction and the director himself does n't seem sure on which way to take this film A buddy film , an action comedy , mystery Seems half way through , he gives up , and is just along for the ride Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers It is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie Jay Leno and Pat Morita prior to involving themselves with this , had spent years pounding out their crafts on the Hollywood circuit Mr Morita had already been a star in his own right , acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult TV and movie classics as Happy Days , and the dismal but affable Mr T and Tina And won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film , Midway , The Karate Kid , and a host of others Mr Leno can been seen on TV shows dating back to the mid 70s And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America He can be seen in countless TV spots and in major films It is a shame , that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense 
The Brain That Would n't Die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits It 's got all the classic signs of being bad unbelieveable plotline , terrible acting , low grade sets and lighting The plotline goes like this When a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident , she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab , where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive I 'll bet Virgnina Leath , who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table Anyway , the doctor then tries to find her a new body , and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body Bad all the way through , so bad it was torn to pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000 
I 've seen some crappy movies in my life , but this one must be among the very worst Definately bottom 100 material \( imo , that is \) br br We follow two couples , the Dodds \( Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene \) and the Kirkendalls \( Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy \) in one car on a roadtrip to Reno br br Apparently , Lonnie is n't too happy with his sex life , so he cheats on his wife with Candy , who 's despirately trying to have a baby Roy , meanwhile , is n't too sure if his sperm is OK so he 's getting it checked by a doctor br br Now , I had read the back of the DVD , but my girlfriend did n't , and she blurted out after about 20 minutes 'oh yeah , she 's gonna end up pregnant but her husband ca n't have any baby 's' Spot on , as this movie is soooo predictable As well as boring And annoying Meaningless Offensive Terrible br br An example of how much this movie stinks The two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada , when they are stopped by 2 police officers , as they did n't stop at a stop sign The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer Not only is this scene pointless and not important \( or even relevant \) for the movie , it takes about 5 minutes ! It 's just talk and talk and talk , without ever going somewhere br br I still have to puke thinking about the ending though Apparently , Roy ISN'T having problems down there so he IS the father of the child How many times does that happen in the movies try something new ! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after Yuck br br Best scene of the movie is right at the end , with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon Why could n't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes \? br br One would expect more from this cast \( although Thornton really tries \) , but you ca n't really blame them Writers , shame on you ! br br 1 10 
 Nada was the most inadequate follow up to Les NOces Rouges which , with hindsight , appears now as the last good movie of Chabrol 's golden era \( 1967 1973 \) Nada is Chabrol 's first real attempt at a wholly political movie its previous work les Noces Rouges had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces Nada includes terrorists , ambassador , hostage taking , a lot of blood , not really Chabrol 's field A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de gr ce only Duchaussoy , who had already played with the director , and Maurice Garrel are up to scratch Viviane Romance , one of Duvivier 's actresses \( la Belle Equipe Panique \) , is wasted as a madam \( Gabrielle \) Italian actors \( Fabio Testi , Lou Castel \) are awful br br With Nada this a second period of barren inspiration for Chabrol It would be Violette Nozi res before he was again at the top of his game 
I just saw this movie \( mainly because Brady Corbet is in it \) , and I must say that I was not pleased br br Of course , the computer graphics were amazing , but the story line needed a little touch up Also , I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood , as well if it were rated PG 13 br br That would definitely attract more people to see it teens What would also attract more teens \( particularly teen girls \) , would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster ! br br Even though the movie had it 's down points , I still saw it and thought it was okay ! 
At first the movie seemed to be doing great , they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however , as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie The characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie Also , there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that did n't seem to fit the movie itself AND the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie I suppose the title works for the previews Actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer , maybe this would have worked out better But it did n't So now there 's a new terrible movie coming out this Friday My opinion ! do n't waste your time or money

Former private eye turned security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession His assignment to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California and apparently wanted by suit and tie racketeers Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre , without enough sting or wit \( or involving plot dynamics \) in the screenplay Director and co scenarist Paul Magwood \( who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement \) does n't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his Chandler was borne from his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled , but also bitter tinged and somewhat indifferent The handling is curiously , commendably low keyed , and Warren Oates is well cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype , but the movie does n't have any snap Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast though neither has much to do , and Caron 's hot and cold running character is exasperating throughout Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold , nice location shooting , but it fails to come to any kind of a boil 1 2 from 
What we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80 's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash cinema completely speechless ! Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy Sword and Sorcery adventure that does n't have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera \( who \? \) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters , but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically In order to make a fantasy adventure you need one super evil villain \( preferably with a black cape \) , one young hero in training , one lone warrior , one amiable type of furry pet , one wise midget living in the woods \( optional \) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons , enslaved dwarfs , and winged gargoyles to serve as filler The story is phenomenal and so original , with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king Simon wants to go back and save the people , but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape Simon befriends lone warrior Kor \( the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check \) , who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals , dangerous encounters and magical showdowns Admittedly it does n't even sound too bad thus far , but that 's merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details Simon has a best friend named Gulfax , for example Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle snout to yelp something incomprehensible The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph , Kor settles an old score with the pig faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there 's the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave' where you can only sing your way out of But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors Simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors , hoping they will assist them in their battle , but the rotting corpses only take a few steps , complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves That 's it ! So much for the zombie sub plot ! Best sequence ever ! I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs , but you get the idea Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a tremendously messed up so bad it 's good film Word of advice do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone Invite friends , preferably the dope headed types with a wicked sense of humor , and watch it in group It will be a night to remember 
European Vacation \( aka National Lampoon 's European Vacation \) is the weakest of the Vacation films \( the first and third one the most superior of the films \) While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold \( with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold \) , this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue This causes the pacing to suffer , with the jokes not very funny at all To be more specific , what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are , are just pasted together into a cobbled together script \) , rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have Oh well , they ca n't win them all 4 out of 10 
Jerry spies Tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis br br I did n't find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame \( Jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one , tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason \) br br There is the occasional flash of inspiration \( such as Tom 's literal 'heart in mouth' experience , and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body \) , but , on the whole , this effort lacks the frenetic pacing , excellent animation and sheer wit of most of T J 's other cartoons 
R zone is an awful movie ! It is so simple It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life Just like Zappa did many years ago But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors Leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes Jul , and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie ! br br Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this , but i think it can show how it can end , if you are letting your child down Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like Film folket ! br br all in all I think people should see R zone Not because it is a great film , but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it , and actually it is in these scenes , Laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun ! 
I could n't believe my eyes once I 've watched this movie There 's no point in it either then blood and violence Unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood , gore , and killing one after another This movie is n't interesting at all , has no meaningful plot or story line , nor does it have an intelligence in it The blood looks very fake and this movie overall , is pointless Do n't even waste your time with it It 's just an hour or two of mindless violence It has many bloody scenes that are n't scary but just plain revolting This is probably the worst horror film I have ever watched out of all the horror films I ever saw

Historically accurate \? Hmm Perhaps if you squint , and light falls upon the subject just so But core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal , patchy and inconsistent plot , reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion The principal characters are merely characterizations embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' American Indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' British officers A wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in American history I want my money back 
I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash ! There are films that are bad , but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you ! The sex sequences , so shocking in its day , could n't even arouse a rabbit The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism The film is self consciously arty in the worst sense of the term The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle Even the sound is bad ! And some people call this art \? br br 
This was n't really a very good movie There were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film but I think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON ! Is n't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film \? A film produced by a former NBA star does n't come along every day , you know Beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho Every clich trotted out for us to groan over Teen sex And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON ! I ca n't say enough about this movie ! Teen drug use ! College hijinx ! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON ! Yippeeee ! 
Unless somebody enlightens me , I really have no idea what this movie is about It looks like a picture with a message but it s far from it This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems And , that s basically all When that agent is played by Pacino , one must think that it must be something important But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is To one of the best actors in the world , Al Pacino , this is the second movie of the year \( the other is Simone \) that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year So , what s going on , Al \? 
Ben Arthur COULD have been a 10 Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie Sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production there was nobody to tell him , Sam this is bad , really bad br br Jamie Brett Gabel 's acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with br br This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie \( twice \) the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places br br A second good point this would make a great date movie after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date ! 
For those of you who 've never heard of it \( or seen it on A E \) , Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight , chain smoking , foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals It 's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of England \( and that 's saying something \) , and was tremendously successful in England and around the world back in 1993 br br Now , the original stars have re teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2 hour episode I 've loved this show ever since I 'd first seen it , over a decade ago The DVD box set holds a place of honor in my collection , and I can quote a good deal of Fitz 's interrogation scenes practically word for word The idea of Robbie Coltrane reteaming with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute glee br br I 'll start with the good One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character Five minutes into the first episode with his lecture \( throwing the books into the air \) , his drinking , and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue and you knew , simply knew , who this character was You could feel him clicking in your mind , the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer br br Coltrane , of course , remained great throughout the show , but I always felt that some of the later episodes those not written by McGovern mistreated the character br br So the good news is this Fitz is back As soon as you see him in this show making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter 's wedding you 'll feel that click once again It 's him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next , always insightful , sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process If you love this character as much as I do , you 'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie And this extends to Judith and Mark in fact , everything having to do with the Fitzs is handled perfectly br br The problem I do have with this movie revolves around the crime Fitz is trying to solve In standard Cracker fashion , we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes the suspense lies in seeing Fitz figure it out In this case , we have a serial killer who is out for American blood And the reason for this , unfortunately , is not due to any believable psychological trauma rather , it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs br br It 's difficult for me to write this , as I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world Nor do I have a problem with movies that are about current issues , or movies that take a political stand But in the Cracker universe , we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings , not like caricatures Instead , the Americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion They 're know nothing loudmouths who complain about everything , treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes I honestly thought I 'd mistakenly switched channels or something br br But it does n't stop there We get constant reminders of just how badly the war in Iraq is going reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere The killer is so busy ranting about how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point , he is such a mouthpiece for the writer 's political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being , and thus we as an audience do n't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial killing soul br br I ca n't say that this ruined the show for me it 's was still good TV , better than almost everything else in the genre \( mainly due to , once again , Coltrane \) But its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real Cracker classics like To Be A Somebody an episode that was just as issuey , but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth br br Two other small points Panhandle not being around is a disappointment , but what 's worse are her replacements The entire police department which for so long filled with such great characters is now full of vanilla Completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality \( how you could drain Coupling 's Richard Coyle of personality is beyond me , but it is indeed missing here \) br br Also , there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me One such instance revolves around Fitz having to narrow down the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria \( French windows \? How does the computer know if I have French windows \? \) he not only succeeds in doing this , but he succeeds in less than an hour I do n't think so br br So , all in all , I was a little disappointed It 's recommended viewing , but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door Still , if there 's new series to come after this , it would all have been for the good I'm convinced that McGovern can still write great stuff , and maybe now that he 's got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people 
I try to be very objective when I view a low budget movie I also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions I expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios Therefore I apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases But this movie was just a dud Period The premise was terrible The main character , Mary Gordano \( Alicia Silverstone \) , was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes There was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world Also , to make this movie more mysterious , the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood , especially in the warehouse br br Once again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points to 
An absolute steaming pile of cow dung It 's mind blowing to me that this film was even made Hip Hop and old westerns just do n't seem to mix What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck br br Not only is the concept and plot a joke , but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke After some research , I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film Jada Pinkett Smith , Denzel Washington , Brandy , Monique , Kim Kardasian , Jenna Jameson , Oprah , and finally Marge Simpson br br Simply put , I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again 
Satan 's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I have seen When I say better I mean the story The film hatches a new plot , something that 's not so clich in the Horror genre something fresh But there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie br br The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV I was tired of all the so called terrifiying Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different The cover art for Satan 's Little Helper immediately caught my attention As you can see , the image draws you in it 's chilling ! I knew it was a straight to DVD release but I took a chance I mean , I just seen Boogey Man the night before so It could n't get any worse ! After I watched the movie , I was semi satisfied I loved the plot of the movie It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend , so he could kill In some sick deranged way , he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners a duo of terror It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night This way , no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid They would simply think he was his guardian But , this is also where the plot holes begin to surface br br If your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating that 's fine You would n't think anything of it if he was 9 ! , or round about the same age as him If however , he appeared with a strange man in a mask , you would be startled and protective of your child You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself You would ask why he is with your son He does n't know him You would tell him to please leave He is n't a family friend He 's a stranger Now , we 're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers In this case , the mum is completely fine with it Huh \? They never seem to think it 's a tad odd that the man does n't speak at all Gruanted they think it 's the daughters boyfriend , but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he 's not saying a word br br The film goes down hill from there The thing that got me the most was , all the mum said was Do you want some cider \? I ca n't count how many times she says this in the movie It 's like , oh you 're dying we have cider though , it 's all good ! ! The movie started promising , and failed to deliver It was more of a horror comedy , and even as that it fails to deliver I guess you could call it a Dud , Flop etc br br The best thing about the movie is the cover art Though , something tells me that 's not worth the 12 dollars !

As I am not a blood and guts fan I found the gory scenes totally unnecessary \( you spell it \) and too real for my liking , if you 're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies I say go for it , it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though br br Apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie , the music was top class too \( through the movie and especially the end credits \) Some parts though were a bit unbelievable , like you 've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there , \( why did n't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it \? \) , come on now , most would probably just scream hurry up and untie me then lets get the f out of here QUICK ! where were the flys , maggots etc , and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells ! I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like , I'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy Christmas 
Lucky me ! I got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in Texas 'horror' flick from Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you I 've rarely laughed so hard in my life as I did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made' from the insufferably stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY \( I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one ! \) From all indications , it was shot on DV , and it does n't really 'look' all that bad quality wise for digital , but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts ! br br The story \( slight and cliche as it is \) goes as follows An executive \( Ken Hebert , who also scripted and co produced with the director \) takes skeptical co worker Tracy \( Amanda Watson \) and horny married couple Mark and Susan \( Hank Fields and Chris Buck \) along on a weekend getaway to a \( yawn \) secluded cabin `12 miles' from the nearest town On the way there , they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker \( Melissa Bale \) in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin , pot smokin friends' disappears one by one , with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates br br The killer clown does n't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box \( aside from being morbidly obese \) It basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods , chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes I cannot say enough bad things about the cast , especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick , who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times Does n't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense , originality , intelligence , general coherence or humor I could go on for days on how inept this film is , how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is , but I 'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that Boy This Sucks kind of way br br Also noting that the film has been released here in the US as S I C K \( SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER \) It 's currently catalogued under its \( original title \) of GRIM WEEKEND br br Score 1 out of 10
The majority of Stephen King 's short stories are little gems , with original ideas that do n't take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages , you read 'em , and you 're finished before you know you 've begun They 're like the equivalent of a carton of McDonald 's fries they taste Really good and you know there 's not much nutritional value in them \( re from a literary standpoint , they do n't say much about the universal human condition \) , but you 're still gonna scarf 'em down , just do n't be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease \( too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in King 's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever Yankee asides get on with the story already ! \) He has compiled four books of short story collections I 've read them all from NightShift to the latest , Everything 's Eventual , and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels br br But his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the TV adaptations of Nightmares And Dreamscapes br br How in the hell did they \( the series' producers \) get a green light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes \? I 'll tell you how two words Stephen King Stories with his name on them probably did n't come cheap , and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones , so what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length , and double the commercial time Ka Ching ! br br I'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what TNT presented Of the four installments so far , here 's my ten cent assessment \( from first to worst \) br br Battleground Not a classic by any means , but hey , how could anyone argue with keeping William Hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog \? And the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer Zuni doll from Trilogy Of Terror proved to me the producers \( and the writer of the teleplay , who is Richard Matheson 's son the writer of TOT \) knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly , yet at the same time , fun It took longer to get to Hurt 's apartment than it should have , but I think it fulfilled it 's objective 8 10 br br Umney 's Last Case Liked this one primarily because of William H Macy 's performance I think the writer Umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye Umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story , and anyone familiar with the King short story \( probably half , if not more of the audience \) knew the Chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer 's reality , so let 's get on with it already , and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee' Private Dick banter already Once the writer Umney 's family tragedy began to reveal though , I thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer \( me , at least \) , feel sympathy for the real life Macy 's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation 's exciting life 6 10 br br The End Of The Whole Mess Uh , this title is how I felt about this episode when it was over After twenty minutes , I was ready to scream at the TV OK , we get it already , the younger brother is a Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire !

Look at it 's scary eye ! Uh huh They could have gone a long way towards filming the Crouch End sequence at night instead of in daylight , too Things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows But I guess the budget was n't high enough to shoot at night on the fake London sets they slapped together for this one On the page , this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they should n't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there The only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying 1 10 br br Overall Series Average \( so far \) 4 10
At first glance , this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 restriction , filled with hyper violence , drugs , gore , sex \( including lesbian sex \) , some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop ! But then , this movie is a succession of bad story \( so thin \) , bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you 're watching a bad Monty Python , bad music \( '80s hard rock \) , the videotaping is awful , the ending is a real shame Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous , the gore not very impressive And those vampires reflect in a mirror , and do n't even fear daylight ! You get to be very disappointed , unless you see it as a Space Mutiny or Troll 2 I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 , because that 's its real place br br I 'd say it can still be fun to watch , if you have friends and enough beer br br 3 10
I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy , and this movie reinforces that As another review said , this is a stalker movie that is n't very funny I watched it because it has CG in it , but he hardly gets any screen time It 's no North by Northwest 
Stereotyped , derivative , unoriginal and boring Western The two popular stars \( Charlton Heston and James Coburn \) both give performances that are far from their best , and justifiably so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue Heston is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and Coburn is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt Additionally , Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold blooded a killer as some of the minor villains Apparently , the filmmakers could n't come up with even ONE original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished \( 1 2 \) 
Wow it 's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile I think that someone else JUST reviewed it a couple days ago br br Anyways , I watched this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl , for the record br br The movie was ridiculous The characters drove me INSANE , they were SO Clich and STEREOTYPED This movie had some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard It had way too many plot twists too br br There is ONE scene in the movie worth seeing however , the scene Warm heart , cold gun where Nick Stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower \( Well , actually they were all obnoxious \) But his acting in that scene was excellent The look on his face , it reminded my of American Psycho \( a good movie \) The scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for , do yourself a favor and do n't watch it 
To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make But what can I tell you \? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star It crosses that barrier It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory Brando had it in spades , Montgomery Clift , Gary Cooper , James Dean of course and in more recent times , Tom Cruise , Jude Law , Johnny Depp , Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup Women fell in love with Garbo , Dietrich , Katharine and Audrey Hepburn , Grace Kelly , Marilyn Monroe , Julie Christie , Charlotte Rampling , Meryl Streep , Vanessa Redgrave , Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman But Brad Pitt has , singlehandedly , redefined the concept He is the only reason to go out , get in the car , find parking , buy a ticket , popcorn and get into a theatre to see Troy If you liked epics in the Jupiter 's Darling style you may enjoy this But if you do n't , go all the same , we want to keep Brad Pitt in business 
I have no idea what on earth , or beyond , could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake Ben Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made In fact , I see no reason why it should not be at 1 on the Bottom 100 For although I have not seen , for example , SuperBabies Baby Geniuses 2 \( 5 at the time of this publication \) , I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound , because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made By contrast , everything , and I do mean everything , in this film is completely unprofessional br br The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right 's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays And I do emphasize intended Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose , it also leaves an ugly scar Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple 's struggle against a society that largely opposes them , it creates tired , crass stereotypes of each party involved Ben and Arthur , the namesake couple , are portrayed as two crude , sex starved , and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so This meets with the opposition of Ben 's brother Victor , a Christian minister who , like all Christians \( as this movie would have us believe \) , is loud , prying , stupid , and violent He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry Just like in real life And if you think that 's dreadful \( it is \) , you have n't seen it all br br The actors \( \? \) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video But not even Daniel Day Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker , for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote For example , in one scene , Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother 's homosexuality But instead of portraying this idea clearly , he spits out the stupid , utterly confusing , whiny sounding line , You know what , I'm never going to have any nieces or nephews , okay , because you 're so F ED UP ! br br Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values Yes , I know this ai n't The Dark Knight , but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing For example , six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds People do not teleport across a room between takes And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot ! br br Do not waste your money on Ben Arthur I do n't care if you 're 7 , 17 , or 107 I do n't care if you 're gay , straight , bi , or undecided I do n't care if you 're just curious I do n't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung heap Stay away , far away This movie 's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee 
In theory , films should be a form of entertainment While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film making most movies , specially genre films , must not only tell it 's story or message , they must entertain their target audience in some way All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low budget , a bad movie is one that is boring br br Hellborn or Asylum of the Damned as is known in the U S , is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving , and irremediably boring and tiresome While it has a very good premise , it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does n't make things better On another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic B movie , but here it is just a bad attempt at film making br br Director Philip J Jones tells the tale of James Bishop \( Matt Stasi \) , a young psychiatry resident , who just got his dream job at St Andrew Mental Hospital but the old asylum seems to hide a secret After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices , James decides to find out what is going on only to find the incredulity of his boss , Dr McCort \( Bruce Payne \) , who believes that Bishop is going as insane as his patients br br While the premise is quite interesting , the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller , Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clich of the genre Of course , there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clich s but in Hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving , resulting in a boring and predictable storyline br br The acting is quite mediocre for the most part , with one big exception Bruce Payne gives a top notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances br br Despite all this flaws , one thing has to be written about Hellborn it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big budget Hollywod horror productions Also , the make up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good Sadly , the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated , making a huge contrast with the make up prosthetics br br Hellborn is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results Hardcore horror or b movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience 3 10
I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel Hardy 's For me , it is n't as close to as bad as Air Raid Wardens and The Bullfighters , but there are some definite huge flaws in it The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a London Bridge dance , surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets , while in the next room , Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor , leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser Then , in come the racketeers , now selling insurance covering up their protection racket One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance , they are arrested br br This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardy 's support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend , Robert Bailey They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents \( Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont \) and hopeful suitor Allan Lane , whom we can tell right off is a no good swine This leads to Briggs' hidden bar being revealed to tea totaling Dumont , and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun , pandemonium ensues The dead pan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on fire br br Later , Hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get Laurel to break a leg to do so There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid \( Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman , after being arrested , their licenses would have been revoked \) Laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog \( only a frosting covered , cake devouring Toto look alike , or possibly the actual pooch \) , causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach roller coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on , perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks Roller coaster gags can be exciting , as evidenced in Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood , and this one is amusing but anticlimactic br br As the story wraps up , all of these gags seem to have no point , giving the impression that this was simply a series of one reelers put together to make a full length feature , hopefully part of a double bill L H , as I 've mentioned in other reviews of their later films , had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roach 's employ , but surprisingly here , they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year Had the gags not been as amusing , as was the case with some of their other films , this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3 
Emma is my favourite Jane Austen novel Emma is well meaning despite her flaws , so readers can forgive and love her , and the relationship she has with Mr Knightley , which is warm , familiar , respectful but playful , generating that warm , fuzzy , romantic excitement Mr Knightley is the perfect man , and Emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent , clever , confident woman remember , she is only 21 , and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws Who does n't want to be Emma \? Who does n't want to be told off by Mr Knightley \? This version of Emma gives you no sense of the things that I love about Emma I could n't even finish watching it , I just found it so awful I could n't see that warm , generous side of Emma , which drives the reader to love her The patience and warmth she shows to her father the closeness between her and Mrs Weston , which demonstrates her willingness to put her friend 's happiness above her own \( as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding Miss Taylors marriage \) Mr Woodhouse 's character in this adaptation just appears bizarre , rather than just quaint , elderly and a bit trying br br This adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between Mr Knightley and Emma Their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection Mr Knightley is indulgent of Emma 's minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray and Emma looks up to him , though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement The dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them , and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as I 've described above Mr Knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads \( or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers \) br br Really horrible I ca n't understand why anyone who truly like the novel Emma could like it , unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point I switched it off 
This sleek , sexy movie is a must see Only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film Personally I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent , no subject left untouched , style of narration The introduction grips you right away , and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film He provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really 'connect' with internal horror this film exhibits The script itself holds the movie together wonderfully Not only for kids , but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience Ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography , it surely defines the word 'masterpiece'

To be honest , this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from Ron Perlman , everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing Bop it under the boom mike or something , and looked completely unrealistic overall , this film is about as scary as Home Alone the only good masters are Cigarette Burns , Jennifer , and maybe Pelts I do n't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand 
After the success of Part 4 , another sequel was a natural move However they should have stopped it before it began Alice , having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims , which of course are Alice 's friends Strange Nightmare movie , very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting The special effects are good , but the movie itself is not 
This one is a real bomb We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate Poor Merle ca n't go anywhere , but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking , quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle Harry Davenport She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show up Some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things , a la Misfits , but no such luck with this one Gary later breaks in to a formal dinner , at which Merle is presiding , and , though invited to sit down and join the group , reads them a lecture on their snobbery Where did this diffident cowboy 's sudden eloquence come from \? The most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife , Merle Will it never end \? One to avoid 
the movie sucked , it was n't funny , it was n't exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good , but failed and thinking it 's cool to like this movie , next to the hype , are the only reasons that this movie is a success br br the fact that at this moment 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me , either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes , and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising It 's success can only be described as a marketing marvel 
Complete drivel An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical , toxic culture of a decade ago In this movie , pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts \( the annoying redhead feeding Shaka rice \? \) Forget historical reality too Did n't most western slaves comes from West Africa \? An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men \? Finally , David Hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious One can only ponder , how would he have fared in the miniseries \? \( Promptly impaled most likely \) The miniseries was superb , and it is unfortunate that DH should have gotten his hands on something unique , and made it mundane \( I tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco \)

Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a 60 , 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed \? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why would n't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her \? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof I do n't know I was not happy with the ending This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad ! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy 
It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor , and put him to waste in a film such as this Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time , but even he could n't save this movie In fact , his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear , which was actually pretty good , but I ca n't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie I believe it gets old , and that is the case here br br There 's nothing surprising in this movie , but then , the story has been told a million times before Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player , and his conceit shows through in his characterization De Niro plays the obsessed fan , but his role in this film is less than entertaining br br However , because De Niro is IN this film , that makes it a draw if you are a fan \( no pun intended \) who sees everything he does no matter how bad But to see De Niro at his best , see Midnight Run , Goodfellas , or Cop Land , or even go way back and check out Taxi Driver or Godfather II Do n't waste your time with this drivel br br My Rating 3 10
 With their no holds bar cruel offensive humor , sure enough to offended anyone , you would sure think this would be a laugh riot ! wrong Worest movie since Open water Do n't be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as I'm sure it wont do very good at all at the box office This movie had a lot of Potential but fell to little to short No enough character development , awkward actors and The upside of this movie was nudity Boobs Amazing If I had to see this movie again , I myself would go POSTAl 
Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list \( Devil Hunter , Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars \) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety , being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore , a gratuitous rape scene , and loads of nudity br br Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle \( a big , naked , bulging eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices \) br br Employed by Laura 's agent to deliver a 6million ransom , brave mercenary Peter Weston \( Al Cliver \) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island , but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double cross During the confusion , Laura escapes into the jungle , but runs straight into the arms of the island 's natives , who offer her up to their god br br Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks crap gore , murky cinematography , rapid zooms , numerous crotch shots , out of focus imagery , awful sound effects , and ham fisted editing The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish \( It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing \) , and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ai n't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry 
I cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children 's television show , power rangers is all about br br I never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place , since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever br br The costumes look completely atrocious , like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym br br What exactly is the purpose of this show anyways , but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems \? What is up with the awful hair cuts , and clothing on this show anyway \? Not to mention this show is still playing on cable television , just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem br br There 's far better entertainment for today 's children , hopefully they are n't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show br br Oh , and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway \? 
I am an actor , producer , director and what i am about to say are facts This project was the worst film in movie making history From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke Why would Blockbuster released such crap \? I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession Was the director trying to make a bad movie \? I do n't think so I seen bad Zombie movies , but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table THIS MOVIE SUCKS ! ! ! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself , but please consider in taking up a different profession I respect the fact that you completed a movie , but i have to ask you WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK , I mean the makeup on your girls , the scary Zombies , what were you thinking To the whole nation , if i could have voted Zero i would have WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY ! ! ! 
There are n't many good things to say at all about Underneath , Soderbergh 's untrue endeavor into neo noir Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak 's decent noir Criss Cross faithfully , not altering the plot very much at all , however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state of the art film noir atmosphere , giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places , lifestyles and anachronisms Soderbergh , who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean 's series with great style and atmosphere , takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest , dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s Nightclubs have terrible , revoltingly dressed garage bands , Peter Gallagher 's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster 's anti hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos , TVs , and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film br br It could 've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score , more flesh to its characters , more than just William Fichtner giving performances that are n't wooden , a crisper pace Unfortunately , Underneath has none of these things Soderbergh , a fine director , does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time That disposition works wonderfully when he 's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned , or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex , lies and videotape With a movie like Underneath , it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer 
The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre This movie is just awful This image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed The fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary And the distributors did they even see it ! \? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen To label this a comedy is an insult to mankind I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it 
Absolutely the most boring movie I have ever spent my money on This was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on Boring ! boring ! boring ! Each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way No acting talent shown just reading a part Alec can play realistic characters normally , Gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part , Annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment Running with scissors leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion There was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen Maybe it was the director 's fault whatever 
An unfunny , unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers' career It is a pity this movie was ever made 
Understand i'm reviewing the film I have seen I realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film , thus neutering it completely When seeing names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached , I knew I was n't going to get a horror classic , but at the very least I expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed But no , this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film , I mean it 's easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes' , but they suddenly cut away , or the scene just totally ends right as it begins How does one screw up cannibals' and porn stars \? I mean thats a winning formula , it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive 's wife or something , because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this Reading about it a few years back in Fangoria , I was excited , it looked like a fun film , but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere , and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled Evil Breed Hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday , as I think a good movie exists in this mess , but until then best grab a twelve pack of Bud , cause thats the only way you 'll make it through this movie 
LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u br br This movie really waste yours time and money I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br Role of CIRCUIT was very small n useless n this movie I think SANJAY DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI br br Character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of OVER CONFIDENCE br br The ideas of MAHATMA is also not define and confusing br br A REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
I'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic The little girl was a brat , their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked Besides it was n't even a gator as the film would like us to believe If you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a Crocodile , not a gator Obviously they did n't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc It is a sad excuse for a movie Especially the ending I nearly fell asleep with this one 
The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable The characters are believable and interesting The cloning lab looks really high tech After that , it all collapses The characters start behaving idiotically , and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor \( and this is supposedly present day \) going critical , the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon only it does n't The finish is incredibly weak One wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong br br All the characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians This results in some weird situations and details , like the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called Bailey Kent despite her heavy accent \( and despite her , on one occasion , inexplicably switching to Spanish ! \) br br Because of the decent start , I considered rating this movie a 5 , but it really was more disappointing than that , so I only give it 4 
Holy crap ! What a terrible , terrible Spanish thriller ! I 've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night I watched an hour or so before heading to bed I was pretty intrigued by the whole thing I finished it last night and could n't believe where I stopped it the night before Literally , I stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill br br Like I said , I was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when Simon receives the package in the bar I picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a menacing game of laser tag Whew ! Then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds WHEW ! You can tell the Spanish industry was definitely behind director Mateo Gil \( co writer of Amenabar 's two big previous hits \) There is an excellent score and great photography But this scenario reeks of silliness How anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me 
Seriously , I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but I just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies \? \? \? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was Thankfully I'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or I would n't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting ! I like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory I will acknowledge this film 's most positive asset , it was very short for a full length film 
This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that I 've yet to stumble across All the previous reviewers act like this is the movie This is NOT the movie Rather it 's merely a featurette that 's an extra on the DVD of the movie The One It also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it 's listed here as In actuality it 's barely over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts and his reflections on the movie So yeah this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar Do n't listen to any of the other reviews as they are ALL wrong You can trust me , because I never feed you , dear reader , BS br br and that 's the truth i guess u can say that i'm the One Reviewer that matters 
Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big Was it his wife \? His Girlfriend \? His Would Be Girlfriend \? Her Father \? His Butler \? The newspaper guy \? Who knows \? And who cares \? The result of this is just a little underwhelming , and the actors here do n't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out Why snake venom as a weapon \? Who knows \? Who cares \? The music in this is alright , but there 's little of it , and most of it is pretty let 's get this over with This is n't worthy of your time There are better all black casted movies out there 
You can call this one a flop , and that 's a very big one too ! Quality is n't associated with the words National Lampoon , but at least the Vacation and Animal House entries were fun , but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that I 've watched Ugh ! The three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clich s and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood genre films , which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross br br Growing Yourself Jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do That 's life , as Jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children , but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one br br Talk about leaden , boring and stiff There only real interest is the small performance of the lovely Diane Lane The satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it The silly humour is strained , flat and particularly senseless Peter Riegert 's keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel bubbles along in her role br br Success Wanters After just finishing collage Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the Dairy Company Presidents For payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the 'very top br br Probably the best one of the three , but the competition was n't too great The gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone , but still they do feel more tacky and forced The idea had something promising and inventive to build on , but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue do n't do it any favours at all The humour tries , but more often does n't come off , despite the hunger The seductively Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout \( well after the painful ordeal \) and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit Even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story Popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from Dick Millar , Mary Woronov , Olympia Dukakis , Fred Willard , Robert Culp and a favourite turn by Joe Spinell br br Municipalians A serial killer who leaves copies of his driver 's licence behind after each murder , is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner However the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go , when the pair encounter one situation after another br br Stupid ! Oh yeah Sure if you 're going to spoof something extremely over the top , make sure laughter will stream off it Obviously they forgot that ! Even at its 30 minutes running , boy does it drag ! Robby Benson 's gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied Richard Widmark doing very little as his partner Christopher Lloyd underplays the role of serial killer , but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads Elisha Cook Jr , Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear When the jokes come , they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clich s br br In all , the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable , and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless Only one or two few gags make it out each segment , but really there 's too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head This is because it virtually becomes what it 's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story It loses sight The performances range from hot to cold , but who ca n't deny the embarrassment that 's felt on most of their faces Director Bob Giraldi 's first taste is a vapid one for Growing Yourself , but Success Wanters showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness Henry Jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on Municipalians Rick Meyerowitz 's vividly crass drawings that opens the film , are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood br br This low brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it , with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos But really , is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get up , just to spot them Well , that 's up to you 
I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while what with all it 's raving reviews , nominations and media attention And I must say , the first quarter of the movie was good ! It really portrayed the black music scene back then However , as the movie wore on , me and my whole family were bored out of our wits The singing just kept coming , one after the other I mean seriously , just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT br br Furthermore , I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters I just did n't care what happened to them ! Even when Eddie Murphy 's character died of a drug overdose , I knew I should have been sad , but I just could n't feel any emotion for that character The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot , but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in br br Finally , the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care , which goes along with the lack of character development This movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on Ray , Chicago , and Rent \( Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion \) Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who does n't really care about an overall story , yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances 
 contains spoiler from both original and movie versions br br i am a huge fan of Notre dame De Paris musical , i also read book this summer and i watched movie today , in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6 3 IMDb point first scenes were good but i actually waited for , theaters scene directly from book , but it was normal but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong they do n't even kiss in book , even in musical br br and there were huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by sorcerer , in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word phoebus wait there were a phoebus were n't there \? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more , the creators made Quasimodo 's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo 's love but Notre dame was frollo his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is , some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts and not mentioning phoebus , not mentioning love of frollo , not mentioning jehan \( brother of frollo \) not mentioning mother of Esmeralda \( maybe it is OK , the storyline would have chopped much \) they even not mentioned the real story \( another PS frollo was n't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold he was stuck in science and religion \) br br finally do n't watch this movie , it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece , and if you have watched it before read the book , god have mercy on you you must read to book immediately br br this movie is worse than hunchback of Notre dame II the animated movie , spend your time with watching Notre dame De Paris musical enough said 
This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film Many changes have been made to the storyline , presumably to streamline the timeframe But what results is simply confusing The acting ca n't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior Plus , the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban Horrible Please please please read the gorgeous novel , in Spanish if possible DON'T SEE THIS FILM It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience 
This movie 's full title is Waqt Race Against Time That 's a race no one can ever win , but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest It strained my credulity too far It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline , and deserves to be mocked for it br br It 's not quite as awful as Baghban or Black , but this movie has nothing to recommend it Stupid , pointless , with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji The central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family BW films If my father , who raised me , and who I love dearly , treated me like Big B did Akshay , I 'd shoot him myself To say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness 
The acting in this movie stinks The plot makes very little sense , but from what I gathered it 's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people 's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies \( or blow their heads up , whichever \) And the effects are lousy , too Most of the movie consists of bad music , with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music , interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes This should be one of the worst things ever made , but for one thing One element of shear brilliance that makes Nightmare Weekend stand above all others And that special quality is the presence of George br br George is the lovable interface device between the scientist 's daughter , Jessica , and the home computer security system With his green hair and nose , balding scalp , and heart shaped mouth , George is the guardian angel confidant to Jessica , who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid With his monotone synthesized voice , George tells Jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses , and also that hitch hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars Of course , little Jessica just ca n't seem to stay out of trouble , causing George to execute Emergency Program Code Protection Jessica , which results in the violent death of Jessica 's would be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls br br Kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light HAL should have been represented by our friend George in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise The light and sound show at the end of Close Encounters \? Not bad , but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been George the Hand Puppet Bishop , Data , R2 kitchen appliances next to the Almighty George ! He might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 , but do n't be fooled This show is all about George With even that limited amount of screentime , George joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as Hollywood Montrose , Majai , and Pappy from New Moon Rising as icons of American cinema George to Apache you are my hero 
A bit of a disappointing film , I 'd say the acting was stilted , somehow In many cases , I just could n't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene An angry \( or sad , happy , frustrated \) character should make the viewer believe that he 's angry \( or sad , happy , frustrated \) That does n't happen here br br The comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt They do things and say things which come out of nowhere the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner then he blows up and storms out , telling his father Do n't touch me , you f ! Maybe , if we 'd seen the prequel , we would understand where all that comes from , but there is no prequel , so we 're somewhat at sea as to the reason ! br br One odd , quirky thing that Andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry , sit down on the edge overlooking the still water below then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up He did this same thing three times during the film I guess we 're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry \? Maybe once , but three times \? It might even have been four times , I lost count br br To be honest , there is the fact that he 's recently found out that he 's adopted this happens very early in the film so there 's no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery It 's not really clear if that 's why he 's so bitter or if it 's about something else br br I guess there is a sort of Lynchian feel to the film but should a first time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career \? 
This has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies I have ever seen in my entire life Just when I think I have seen the stupidest scene in history , along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene I think the transvestite poodles did it for me , or better yet , her talking tongue or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat Decisions , decisions 
This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life The acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible Whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant As for special effects the film has none The whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are stabbed \( if you can even call it that \) their reactions are totally unreal The guns are more quiet than a mute How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind Well thats about it This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons I have said that it includes a spoiler If the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film 
'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie It 's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star The only thing he needs is to get her on stage , surrounded by cameras and reporters A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail The problem with the movie is not the basic plot , but how it is made Everything is supposed to be funny , but it is n't It is trivial and clumsy , the characters are shallow , and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing , but only at how pathetic the whole set up is 
 but the keyword here is usually I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb But in the world of B rated movies , THIS one is Z rated Absolutely ridiculous The thing I respect about most of my favorite B rated movies are that they do n't take themselves too seriously The makers of movies like that sort of treat the movie lightly , even if it 's a heavy topic I get the impression , however , that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously , like they were putting together a 10 star classic , complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots Nevertheless , despite all this , I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars , as I am biased towards movies like this If you 're a B rated fan , however , I would try too hard to find this one 
I fell asleep on my couch at 7 35pm last night watching Larry Sanders \( I usually DirecTivo it , but not last night \) Woke up at 3am \( invesment banker on the west coast \) , and was fascinated to see this on HBO2 I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was Seriously shocked So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB This is really really bad the writing is boring , but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school br br Yes it is shot video Mind you , that is shot on VIDEO , not DIGITAL VIDEO It does look like a soap opera The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror br br I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything The shots and blocking are stupid yes , i chose the word 'stupid' not unconventional , not daring , not bold , not boring , just stupid I know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example I cant It was 3am but trust me , I know you will watch it anyway , you will be drawn by the horrible reviews br br 
I really hate this retarded show , it SUCKS ! big time , and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind \( if you believe in fairies that is \) I mean the people who had come up with such crap 'ought to have their heads examine huh \? and also there is a LOT of craziness \( the evil school teacher , which I think is getting really old \) and also stupidity \( the boy 's parents and fairy godfather \) in this show two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world \( especially stupidity \) br br Overall , I say that this show is so f ' annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at ALL \( it would make'em bleed to death \) ! 
I do n't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business ! This movie \( short \) is gross \( to say the least \) ! It is a bunch of 5 7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins , acting like adults \( and too much so ! \) However , it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all ! \( Thank GOD we have laws against this kind of material now ! \) br br This is one short from the Shirley Temple Festival 
Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable \? I think not Basically the movie is clich after clich and really nothing ever comes as a surprise It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it 's a failure This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely I mean , no way this could ever happen in real life , as in the same way as the events occur in this movie So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem br br But it truly are the clich s that killed the movie It was cringing stuff at times Everything is so formulaic in this movie The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless , almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman , who acts like she did n't see any of this coming Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason Such as the sequence in which the 'predator' fixes the 'victims' broken car That has got to be one of the oldest clich s out of the book I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point The movie is filled with moments like these br br The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie Which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub plots to make the movie even more drama like br br I 'll admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie She makes some of the clich s and events look even almost realistic at times Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie Showgirls , so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one It 's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better All of the other characters are a disappointment Corey Sevier plays the clich pretty 'untouchable' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse He looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence He wakes up , he wants sex Before he goes to sleep , he wants sex He gets home , he wants sex It might be a realistic thing but I do n't know , it just did n't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general br br A clich filled movie and I ca n't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie It 's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility Not an 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clich elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one br br 4 10
First of all , I 'd like to tell you that I'm into comics , anime , animation and such stuff It is true that everyone has his own preferences , but you can trust me on this movie I 'll be objective To begin with the story it 's OK Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them But the animation Well , it 's not actually terrible , but it 's definitely cheap and mediocre It would be a lot better if they did n't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985 Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better ! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable , the music is nothing special So all in all it lacks atmosphere I watched it , but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it It just does not capture you There 's plenty of blood and violence , but that does not impress me at all May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time \( is there anyone around \? \) , but I do n't think this is the audience for this movie So they could add a little nudity and spice to it The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty , and hell , we have Lady Death herself ! There are few sexy looks , but that 's not enough Instead of Bill Brown 's music I think it would look better on a hard rock heavy metal soundtrack All in all the movie is n't that bad , but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal , Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 , Ralph Bakshi 's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe And of course Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust
Comedy Central has a habit of putting on great programs at times Chappelle 's Show , The Daily Show , Colbert Report , and then there are those that some people love or hate Stella , Dr Katz Then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful Mencia , and now , Sarah Silverman br br This show is based on the fact Silverman is self Centered , which can be funny \( Colbert Report \) but can be horrible \( Mind of Mencia \) It should shock no one that I believe the latter is the case This show is a parody of a sitcom and society , a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply is n't funny A woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that 's common We do n't need 25 minutes of it When a criminal is disarmed by a queef , it simply loses its appeal we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike back , except the women were hotter , and the whole scene was more absurd , making it better But the best comparison of this show is to Stella , except Stella was more subtle , which is what made the absurdist comedy funny It had better acting , and I suppose , a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br Perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative \( I'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction \) to this show is the amount of advertising on it , very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs Many people are wondering why Sarah Silverman has a career , and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled This show should 've never made it past the unaired pilot stage Back to Norm showed far more promise , yet this show makes it further And as far as critics being correct , many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely Last I checked , Britney Spears gets good reviews too also Take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on IMDb for not liking this show 
A still famous but decadent actor \( Morgan Freeman \) has not filmed for four years When he is invited to participate in a new project , he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet \( Paz Vega \) and he becomes attracted with her ability His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time br br I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega However , the pointless 10 Items or Less is absolutely disappointing This low budget movie does not seem to have a storyline , and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous , with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family \? Or was a clash of classes , and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes \?

Even though there 's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from , this 'Succubus' is often named as THE best Jess Franco film Heck , even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites So , maybe it 's me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie The opening is great , though , and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage It 's all downhill from here , unfortunately Reynaud 's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations , beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score This COULD have been his greatest film indeed , if it was n't for the lame and uninteresting story It 's supposed to be psychedelic but I 'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what 's shown here Half of the time , you do n't have a clue what 's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages This most certainly is n't Franco 's best film according to me I would n't even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans If you 're looking for more superior Jess Franco film , try to get your hands on 'Las Vampiras' , 'The awful Dr Orloff' or 'Female Vampire' 
What do you expect when there is no script to begin with , and therefore nothing that the director can work with Hayek and Farrell , and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors , they just do n't have anything to say or anything to react to Even the earthquake was pretty poor And I do n't know how closely the movie follows the novel , but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice , warm heart , but some stereotypes do n't amount to anything And he even buries Camilla out in the desert , instead of bringing her back to L A for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while Pathetic And the L A set was ridiculously graphically created Anything good \? The window to his apartment felt real , the curtains , the sounds , the wind And Donaldson is always great Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead , whichever it was 
This movie shows us nothing original Every idea or \( action \) scene can be found in many previously released movies Fabulous Nick is completely plain here Even Will Patton is calm and evil nor good Mr Duvall is ok , but has a very small part So does Angelina , so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom \? Overall , there are too many characters , so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed This makes the movie easy to forget Too bad , do n't you think \? 
 Sky Captain may be considered an homage to comic books , pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences I do n't think this is at all true One 's expectations of the films , fiction and serials that Captain pays tribute to were entirely different Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama Toward the climax of Captain Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency br br One does n't expect films like this to necessarily make sense One does expect them to be fun , thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic Captain has almost none Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge \? Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side \? They can FLY ! ! ! The chasm itself means nothing to them The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape \? If the land across the chasm is 'forbidden' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if br br I know that Paltrow and Law \( both of whom have given fine performances in the past \) were playing types but both were pretty flat Only Giovanni Ribisi \( who showed himself capable of great nuance here \) and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he 'd only been given the chance He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted br br The film had a great 'look' but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical , when it is used to create creatures who do n't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints There is no real sense of wonder A CGI mountain does n't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it was n't necessarily supposed to LOOK real but should n't it FEEL that way \? It just did n't br br As for the weak and clich d script homage is no excuse Even so , had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable The Last Samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that Captain did n't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that Sky Captain most definitely did not br br I 'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30 's and 40 's The original \( Jay Garrick \) Flash or Green Lantern \( Alan Scott \) come to mind as being ripe for such treatment Maybe the better , more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film It would be hard to be worse 
I always felt that a good film should have a plot This particular film was missing one , and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever I was anxious for it to finally end However , I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long it felt like four hours Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict It 's not the worst movie I 've seen , but I used to say that it was until I saw The Fast And The Furious So , do n't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action I actually hate most action films out today it 's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum Not much really happens in this movie However , the scenery and costumes were nice 
Anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we 're about to see ca n't ever be known and This is the whisper rumor most often told about one of Hollywood 's most sensational mysteries br br Okay So we 're not getting anything new \( and E ! 's Mysteries Scandals gives you a better foothold on the particular incident and that 's not much of an endorsement \) What do we get \? br br We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper 's and decadents No big news there More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and or political establishment It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters But what 's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled , we 're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history br br The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun We 're not empathetic with anyone And the great Citizen Kane polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way In The Cat 's Meow we 're not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst As soon as we 're told one thing , she 's off doing the other br br And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain 's life \? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America 's most powerful and apparently moronic citizens The film never makes it clear br br What is convincing are the production values There 's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men 's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well known personalities in Hollywood history No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying br br The performers ca n't be faulted , although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here Kirsten Dunst never disappoints She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material , but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it One of her first lines is , I'm not here ! And I'm sure she wishes she was n't br br This is n't on par with Bogdanovich 's trashy , so bad it 's good At Long Last Love It 's perched on attempting something serious , but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it 's so full of bitterness towards the beast named Hollywood This is National Enquirer filmmaking And it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the Oneida that weekend , but the audience gets pretty dirty as well 
I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid I snuck downstairs really early one morning , started watching HBO , and The Raft \( segment 2 \) terrorized me good This time around , I still enjoyed The Raft , although I could n't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short The other two segments were complete trash I ca n't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk All I 've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics 4 10
This movie was craptacular I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies' biggest antagonist was , in fact , myself I played it beautifully throughout promising myself I would walk away , but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way Even in this state , I could n't help but notice that Cuba 's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards Burt came on the screen as a General , that 's right , a General \( who wears too much makeup \) I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cuba 's , except mine was real and I stubbed my toe Recompense ! Recompense my stubbed toe !

Perhaps it 's because I am so in love with the William Holden Kim Novak version , or because I'm not a Gen X'er , but this was absolutely the worst remake I have ever seen Without the original 's soundtrack , it just seemed like another typical TV movie yes , about as bland as Kraft cheese

From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father 's considerable wealth and power , and he is struggling to both fill his father 's shoes and cut the apron strings mother \( and co executive \) keeps too tight He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later , such as his friendship with his surgeon \( Terrence Howard \) and his romance with a middle class girl \( Jessica Alba \) Uncreative story lines , but not bad enough to ruin the movie The only real oy vey ! moment was the name of Lena Olin 's character Overbearing woman named Lilith subtle ! br br The surgical scenes are not at all censored I appreciated that , people who find surgery scenes scary might not The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia , he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him br br The big twist , however , is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he , like us , initially missed br br There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother One is an impressive gesture by Olin , which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing The other is a secret about the family 's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless br br The initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama There is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat , taking the entire movie with it 
After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast furious series So , I already expected it to have a lacking storyline , but at least this time it wo n't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans Unfortunately , I was wrong If you could only imagine a Fast Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you br br This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen \( I'm being nice no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said \) Not only was the storyline non existent , but the action was crap too I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie For an example , there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his girls \( an Imus comment would work in this case \) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert After this wonderful scene I could n't take it anymore So , I only got to see half of this monstrosity This is the first movie I had ever walked out on Afterwards , I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells br br I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option You 're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home I will keep all viewers in my prayers 
WOW ! Pretty terrible stuff The Richard Burton Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco Taylor plays a rich , dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates , very loudly , her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend , Taylor realizes her time is up Ludicrious in the extreme it 's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing If that 's the case , then the acting is brilliant ! Burton mumbles his lines , including the word BOOM several times , while Taylor screeches her 's She 's really awful So is Noel Coward as Taylor 's catty confidante , the Witch of Capri br br Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along two standard Williams themes , but it 's so misdirected by Losey , that had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues , any substance the film has would have been completely diluted br br BOOM does have stunning photography the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia ! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus , the great Romolo Valli as Taylor 's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard both he and his dogs do a number on Burton ! 
This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare 's most vibrant plays I can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare before By doing this , though by making every line clear and every intent obvious they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature Somehow , it is actually boring a very hard feat given such wonderful material br br The acting is forgettable at best Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro Others , however , do not fare so well April Shawnham 's Hero is a pouty , breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces Jerry Mayer 's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash \( though Snidley was much more enjoyable \) br br F Murray Abraham \( you know , the guy who killed Mozart \? \) is not in this version , unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits br br Given that the producer , Joseph Papp , is basically a theater god , this production is not only disappointing but head scratching as well br br Do n't bother with this Watch Branagh 's Much Ado instead his version is overflowing with vitality and humor , to say nothing of wonderful performances 
Somewhere inside this movie is a half hour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out Whereas Cube was taut , well made , claustrophobic and mind engaging , I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated , tedious rehash of several well worn themes which just do n't add up to much , especially if you have seen almost any other half way decent sci fi film before br br Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending None of the characters spark off each other , and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube It 's not a bad movie , but it is most definitely not a good one br br When you 've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film , but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating 
Where to begin \? How about with the erroneous synopsis br br X Men Origins Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine 's epically violent and romantic past , his complex relationship with Victor Creed , and the ominous Weapon X program br br His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non violent br br His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it 's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run , to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan , and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins br br There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving br br The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt We are thrown into a romance so fast that it 's over before you can blink an eye Having just introduced the character , Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later We are left wondering why we should care about this Who was she anyway \? br br For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story , the romance is surprisingly unexplored It was rushed in simply because it was required br br Oddly enough , when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise br br As for the weapon X program , lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are n't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn Is it any wonder what fate awaits them \? br br In the previous films and the comic books , the main reason that Wolverines' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded br br Knowing this was the case did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates \? br br As hinted to in X2 X men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together This film sets up the team fairly well only they do n't really do much of anything No disturbing violence , no ruthless actions , they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen br br It seems that Wolverine was n't an evil man under Stryker at all Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was Eventually he just leaves all together br br No conflict of duality here at all br br Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely They may as well have given him rubber claws br br There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X Men trilogy , including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script br br Magic memory erasing bullets br br Really \? br br Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all br br Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story Most were in the film for 5 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine br br Fred Dukes \( the Blob but not the comic version \) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him \? br br Cyclops optic beams \( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers \) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes Adamantium trench coats anyone \? br br The \( gravity defying \) mutant Gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine How he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained br br Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect br br The comic book source material , the REAL origin of Wolverine is a story worth bringing to the screen It does n't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor Smith A much more intense and exciting story br br This FOX film should seriously be forgotten br br Anyone have that magic gun \?

This movie is just boring br br It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in Am lie Poulain , but it is too much The dialogs are pretty bad , some of the worst I have ever heard , Guillaume Canet is not convincing \( I have almost never found him very convincing \) , his father in the movie plays very badly , the story is dumb , the ending is stupid br br I think I have not dislike a movie so much since le pacte des loups \( brotherhood of the wolf \) from Christophe Gans \( and I watch see about 80 100 movies a year \) , but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors br br I had never commented here \( only rated \) , and when I saw the rating and the comments , I thought I had to write something down br br I guess we wo n't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered not such a bad movie in our \( large \) collection ! ! ! br br I am open minded \( I watch SF , westerns , drama , comedies , silents , horror , fantasy movies ! \) , but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half 
I 've seen other Guinea Pig films , like Mermaid in a Manhole He Never Dies , and while they 're pretty sick , they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them \( however dark \) Devil 's Experiment though , is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there 's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever It is n't remotely scary , except for perhaps the mind set , but it 's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment Now , I'm not the paragon of good taste in films and I like my trash and sleaze , but this was too much for me , really I'm all for disturbing , in fact , I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible , but this was a bit much The young woman is kicked , beaten , submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools , and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere If you think that sounds great , go for it , but it certainly put me off viewing any more Guinea Pig stuff 1 out of 10 , absolutely nauseating 
When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles , it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad I saw the version on video called Rosemary 's Disciples Yes , I am sure it differs from other versions , but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have going to be really any better The story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists \( yep , it gets bad this early ! \) The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr Cato the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back \( hence the name Necromancy \) The people in the town do witch kind of stuff have ceremonies , some like wearing a goat 's head , and promiscuity abounds \( not much really shown in this area \) , but none of these people are very good actors Mr Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger than life movie maverick Orson Welles Welles is misused , but , make no mistake , he is the best thing in this movie And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance In one scene at a party , director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames ! It looked ridiculous As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman 's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed This also applies to the corny , hokey ending The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent Other than her performance , real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine This is not a good movie in any way under any name 
Why do I constantly do this to myself \? I mean , really , it 's right there in the title The Incredible Melting Man What else would I expect \? I have to admit , I'm a sucker for just about anything I come across on the Monster HD channel , but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary Rick Baker As for creepy , I 'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out Now they were truly scary br br Something I could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster 's victims would n't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation Like the chick in the cabin You know , there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time Incredible Steve O could n't muster much more than a brisk walk , so why not just blow right by him \? I do n't know , maybe I'm missing something br br This flick had some of the feel of a 'Tales From The Crypt' episode , but 'Tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you did n't see coming This was one picture that you could n't quite get a handle on coming OR going For example , in an early scene , you can clearly make out that Melting Man 's eyeball fell out of his head , so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story \? I guess we 're not supposed to ask br br At eighty four minutes , this picture was about an hour and a half too long When it was all over , I was ready to take up General Perry on his earlier suggestion I could really use a drink about now 
If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood , let it be boy But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio br br After having watched such a good movie as Arisan \( 2003 \) , it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia It seems that the only idea is to make money , but no one seems seriously to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment That it is a 'global' world does n't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'Made in Indonesia' with a flavor of the west , they get away with it br br OK , the story is nice to begin with And it could have developed into a nice flick But did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music OR at least good playback , and secondly good choreography \? In this movie , the playback is SO BAD that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema Every single word you hear is followed seconds LATER by the actor or whoever sing playback , and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie br br The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics , but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical They only forgot to change the choreography It is hardly dancing you see , they jump here and there , throw their legs up in the air , and that is about it br br Well , at least there 's a happy ending But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic , DO SO ! 
A boring movie about a boring town in the 50 's How can anyone think this is a classic \? The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend , Cybil Shepard , into several movies that were way above her acting ability I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch 's future movies were going to be Cybil Shepard 's career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced It was n't until Moonlighting that her career started to come back I thought the acting was poor rendition of the , Graduate I have noticed that this movie has n't been shown in the US The only place I have watched it was overseas in Europe late at night 
This guy has no idea of cinema Okay , it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth , and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship This all is very good , but look carefully HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB ! The scenes are unbalanced , without proper start and and , with a disordered content and full of emptiness He has nothing to say about the subject , so he over licitates with violence , nakedness and gutter language How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art \? Why do n't they let him succumb in piece \? 
The fight scenes were great Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side It was the ending that I hated I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back But to travel all that way just to start over \? Are you kidding me \? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise , they abandon technology \? No way Sure they were eating paper and rationing food , but that is over They can live like humans again They only have one good doctor What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth yea right No one would have made that choice 
this movie has no plot , no character development , and no budget it really sucks to put it in short terms Since there is no development for the movie , it really ca n't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it To be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak Well it falls short here too The girl 's reactions just seem dumb it 's extremely easy to tell that it 's fake \( honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie They throw innards on her , but she 's asleep for most of it , so it 's just kinda dumb The only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye But honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake , with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture , go watch Hostel and Hostel 2 Not only do they both contain realistic violence , but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people Plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like American fears of foreigners , issues of morality , testing how far a person can go , human instincts vs civilization , and many other things Plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story is n't focused on the violence These are much better choices over this piece of crap
My kids picked this out at the video store it 's great to hear Liza as Dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom But there are too many bad songs , and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time 
Resnais , wow ! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour The opening voice over with old , embellished inter titles was a nice touch Then the camera aperture opens \( like the old hand crankers \) on a black white placard The camera backs off \( or rather , up \) , suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party This is all in the first 60 seconds br br Then the music starts A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film \( and yes , I speak French , so I ca n't blame it on the subtitles \) Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song Then they leave , and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film br br I'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out I endured br br It did n't get much better I 'll tell you why There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters We do n't even see their faces half the time \( as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera \) People flit on off stage like moths around a lamp , and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot It 's as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie With bad songs br br The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did \( 1 hour \) was that I was looking at the camera techniques , lighting and scenery which were all , I admit , excellent But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours \? Not me Maybe tomorrow I 'll try watching the end Aw , who am I kidding I have more important things to do I'm sure you do , too Skip this 
A movie has rarely left me as cold as this one There is not a bit of tension , not a second of fear , not a moment we jump , even a little bit The girl is cute , yeah That 's it Was that worth a movie \? I knew it was n't supposed to be a great movie , but I was at least expecting one

If you 've read the original novel , as I did , you will probably hate this thing br br The film version of Absolute Beginners is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a period piece set in the late 1950s and failing to re create or even pay homage to that period the US monstrosity of Dirty Dancing does similar to 1963 , except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing In addition to suffering from looking too 1980s , the characters have been changed , re arranged , and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and , of course , their names Suze is transformed from the narrator 's flighty ex girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money \( at her own admittance in the first few pages \) into a hapless and naive Eve archetype seduced by fame and glamour , exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss , who surprisingly was n't given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle She and the narrator , re named Colin \( after the book 's author , Colin MacInnes \) for the film , are also in a relationship br br Big Jill 's character , a lesbian seemingly butch yet fop like in her mid 20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble headed lesbians , and one of the narrator 's closest friends , dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator , is reduced to a sort of named extra with only a few throw away lines , and tonnes of comical outfits br br The Fabulous Hoplite , a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel , is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film , camped up and all but ignored br br The narrator 's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film , he 's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood , and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator 's mum seems , for all practical purposes , ignored br br In its favour , the music \( for what it is \) is well composed , and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book \( some days , they 'll write musicals about the 1950s \) as their inspiration to write a musical , but in the world of bad camped up musicals , this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch Unlike Shock Treatment or Starstruck crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts Unlike The Apple , there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue br br You really ca n't blame it 's too 1980s feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s The film version of Annie released in 1981 , pays a wonderfully well executed tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s , and Napolean Dynamite manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 \( though it 's not explicitly set in the 1980s , those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film feels very 1980s \) Obviously , it was possible to make something good out of this , especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK , but it fails most apparently in the look and feel , and also in its treatment of the source material , which is downright disrespectful br br Perhaps if you have n't read and have no intentions of reading the novel , you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late 1950s Soho London 's modernist jazz set I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting , but they definitely could have done better With Boy George as a household name and mixed race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK , they definitely did not need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing In fact , I 'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen aged audience like two bit idiots to make a quick buck off of 
The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way The script , the dreary pace , the lack of depth in any character , the pointless sub plots , the dreadful acting , the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I 've ever seen I found nothing likable , enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way br br I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark , with its moody lighting , long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack If so , they failed utterly It just bored me , and I wish I had never watched it br br Avoid at all costs

Was there a single positive to this film \? Critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made No damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example br br And I may have missed something , but was n't Super Mario Bros 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before \? Well if that IS the case , and I did not miss anything how did Fred Savage 's character , and even the girl , know so much about the game already \? We 're talking things that some people do n't know about by their second or third play through br br Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself Nothing here is honestly very memorable The kid was n't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points The characters are bland and completely uninteresting , the 'Wizard' \( the youngest child \) is a very silent , completely dry child clich of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma It is n't that this is unrealistic , it 's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes br br Honestly , the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature If you grew up with this movie you 're going to like it whether it was good or not It was about kids playing video games , and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well But unless you loved it as a kid there just is n't anything that 's going to keep you interested , and very little that will prevent you from turning it off br br No sir , I did n't like it 
Not a `woman film' but film for the gang One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman Director Andy McKay simply does n't know woman Peaks of bad taste , American Pie 's humor style , crude story , no sense , groundless story , refuted characters Vulgar fantasies came to life on screen Insulting and definitely not funny I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it 
This film is so bad dialogues , story , actors and actresses everything ! that it 's hard to imagine that we 'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years Love 's Brother \( set in Australia among Italian immigrants \) has nothing but shallow clich s about Italian culture to offer , and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film The message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people , beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation' , but here his pseudo Italian accent is hard to bear See this film at your own risk Trash as trash can ! 
This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 and it 's the bad one Apparently all his energy went into Nemesis which was an entertaining non stop action movie , and had a much more expensive look Knights is clunky and cheesy , a bottom of the barrel sci fi that too often resembles a video game \( new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible \) The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long not a particularly attractive woman , but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine As for Kris Kristofferson , considering his age at the time \( 58 \) , I hope his stunt double was well paid \( 1 2 \) 
Saw it yesterday night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal What a disappointment This movie is clearly over rated by IMDb fans The acting was only but regular The directing did n't bring anything new or interesting The plot lacks considerably the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls \( 7eventy 5ive \) And on top of that , you can predict the movie 's end in the first five minutes If you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie , you might like it If you do n't , this movie is not worth it 
The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie A blend of the two genres just does n't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary If it is meant to be a thriller drama this is too dull and monotonous In either case , what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience \? That around us there are people who ill treat others who are willing to be ill treated \? That there are many crazy lunatics around us \? So so what \? 
Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made Some of the actors are terrible They over do it seem fake I can always tell how it 's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear It 's not very well written either I love to watch it to laugh at it You know the saying It 's so bad that it 's good \? Well , that saying applies to this show I also like to watch just to see if I'm right when I guess how it 's all going to end So far I 've been right every time It 's like a little game that I play It 's nice when you are bored you feel like laughing at something 
It 's been a while since seeing this the first time , so I watched it again with the second movie in the series While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I have n't seen yet , I 'll review under the original title br br Just from the standpoint of production value , screen writing , and movie making , this movie fails on many levels , though it succeeds on a few as well What can you expect from a low budget , B movie \? Not much , and it works from the standpoint of production However , the writing is certainly disjointed , with little in the way of character development exactly what I 'd expect when there is an agenda to a film I did n't have a problem with the acting the cast is solid however , the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves Because the film is Christian , this is predictable , as you ca n't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity In other words , the mistake comes in making this into a G rated film when the content , even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations , would be R rated by any measure So , if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith , then the movie should be somewhat scary , right \? However , you ca n't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book , or in this case , series of books There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies but not the Left Behind series and these movies ultimately fail because , while being best sellers , they are poorly written novels based on bad theology br br As a Southern Baptist minister , I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me , though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series I have described them as decent fiction , and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology \( study of the end times \) , then I could live with that However , this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic Inevitably , this leads to the pre trib , pre millenial dispensation point of view , which confines an all powerful God far too by humanity 's world In other words , as I 've always said , God should n't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work But because many people , particularly unstudied Christians , ca n't think beyond their own world views , we are left with a pro conservative , fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation , and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation br br Thus , the books carry with them an agenda , not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ , but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible I recall very clearly reading \( several years ago \) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his non adherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured could n't possibly hold to another eschatology This is disturbing for several reasons , the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it 's connection to real , end time prophecy is tenuous at best br br But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior Ultimately , I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith religion instead of win people towards it It turns all Christians into caricatures , equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice As a Christian body , on the whole , we 've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history and we certainly do n't need to promote it by film to thousands , maybe millions of others br br Thus , the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books are n't worthy to be interpreted into movies 
What I think I 'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film , Phantom Menace , is that it will likely blow Titanic out of the water , if you 'll pardon the pun , when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts , and thereby knock it out of the number one spot Every time I hear someone declare Titanic is the greatest film they 've ever seen , I think to myself , You do n't see a lot of movies , do you \? What a travesty You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than Titanic , and for the same price tag br br Well , it won lots of academy awards , lots of people really loved it , as someone might say in its defence Well , lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald 's , but that does n't mean it 's high quality Yes , millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong br br I 'll be the first to admit , that part of the problem for me was the mega hype over the film I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately , it did n't live up to the expectations set upon it , which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story It 's true , Phantom Menace will likely suffer a similar fate but br br James Cameron 's Titanic is a \) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece b \) a three hour epic that has it 's finest moments given away in the trailer c \) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d \) something left better to documentarians , which I would 've enjoyed much more e \) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f \) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back , therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of When I meet someone who has n't seen it yet , I say , I wish I could trade places with you g \) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences \? h \) thankfully a film that was n't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars i \) a technological achievement in filmmaking , and little else br br The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10 , 000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who 'll no doubt come to his defense , and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic 's story , acting or length 
Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since , in fact , most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events Unfortunately , what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom One cares not who wins , loses , dies or lives just end it as soon as possible This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way One cannot expect the amazing effects of The House of the Flying Daggers or The Golden Compass , but , after all , this is a 2002 digitally mastered production Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene , so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms In my view , this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the papier mache revolution of a papier colle world 
I thought that this movie was pretty lame If you 're looking for cheesey , you may like this I , myself , do n't mind a fair amount of cheese , but this was ridiculous The progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak br br The only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies , but even that is n't reason enough to see this flick 
The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy But let 's look at the obsolete theme of the movie br br With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom Since Watch on the Rhine , author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story Julia from her book Pentimento As one of the most odious of a plethora of Western based USSR apologists , it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists , who had just proved their military superiority in Spain br br As one reviewer correctly noted , this is not a pro American play and movie , as Lillian went to her grave an American loathing communist This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then , just as now the full mooner Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy America 
a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing the movie twists and turns through miriad plot surprises at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing , offcourse puncturing the plot with steamy scenes they thought would help it along br br james belushi is involved in this pseudo intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie the same applies for the other actors the plot is quite silly and tacky whih in itelf is not such a crime , but towards the end , the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring br br however , the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day , but do n't fret if you miss this one br br a rather lame 4 ! 
I felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plot kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money One of Robins Williams worst films if you do n't believe me wait a few months it will be out on DVD because that seems to be a pattern for movies that do n't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over This is one you will not want to see or say why did I spend my money on that ! Plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it This was on a Friday night the 9 50 showing I also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake When they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying 
Is Miike like Chabrol , alternating art with dreck , sometimes confusing the two \? Does he match the fifty fifty rate some claim for Chabrol \? Do we see here too much or too little Miike \? I do n't know I do n't know I do n't know But I could easily fill ten lines just citing Chakushin ari 's \( One Missed Call 's \) steals , allusions , and clich s Others here will hit on most of them , though not perhaps Ochiai 's Saimin \( Hypnosis \) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural Only once , when Yumi takes the zombie like mother in her arms , did One Missed Call startle me a little br br One other point of interest Renji Ishibashi \( looks like Christopher Walken \) as the detective Ishibashi in Audition 's abusive back story , and as Dead or Alive 's Boss Aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more , may be the most convincingly evil character actor I 've ever seen So here he 's a cop 
Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred , I felt that the film was n't the best I had seen At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it br br Bette Davis did a perfect job , though , and she made me hate her and pity her all the while Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey , and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame It 's such a sad thing when one finds him herself in love with a bad seed And especially if it 's someone like Philp Carey , who is a sensitive person , though pathetic br br In the end , the acting was what came through and not the plot The ending scene was particularly good , but I am not one to give it away Although others may find this movie good , I was one who found it so so I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person 
Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex So he buys a van to aid in this quest The acting is lame , the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clich s and cheap thrills The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time , but fell a long way short They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin , because this will supposedly add comedic value br br I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film If you like DeVito , this is another classic DeVito kind of role but he 's only a supporting actor and there for clich value 
Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions , but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival , a scion of the Genji clan The film making has the main hallmarks of a low budget production , including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages \( the kind you might find in an under produced dorama \) The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night , but he does n't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time but which could earn him enlightenment br br There 's no absence of ambitiousness , however , in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film making style br br A disappointment 
Admittedly , Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone , although it is a favourite of mine , Knappertsbusch , 1951 , in particular Syberberg 's entire approach is so static Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless Whatever happened to film editing \? The result is physically exhausting to watch The viewer is never spiritually transported Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right , Syberberg got it wrong And that set decoration with those clever reminders of Wagner 's anti Semitism will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner \? 
normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies , but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind ! ! ! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective , it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments , the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout Another seen was the family photo i was n't expecting that and i jumped out my seat ! ! ! i would recommend everyone to see this movie , with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time ! ! ! ! ! 
boring stuff we got here His 5 minute shorts are better than this know why \? because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is br br The plot is kinda eh the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny \( I had my hopes up , the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny Just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh not working br br Maybe next time knox br br Maybe re cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good 
I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie Its a big joke Good Its entertaining You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to br br Priety \( a pros \) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman Rani who want a child but ca n't I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life take off from a real couple 's life br br Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her Salman She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance When will the audience get fed up of Salman 's nakhras br br Though a good past time , this movie is unbearable Absurd 
Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television \( or the media in general \) as the 1960s \? No And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time \? Not really But if we must have one , does it have to be as shallow as The '60s \? br br I like to think that co writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted , especially given Couturie 's involvement in the superb HBO movie Dear America Letters Home From Vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage , letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production , but it does n't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its ilk , it 's seen from the point of view of one family But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s \( it 's amazing that one of them does n't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont \) , making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade br br The makers rush through it so much that there 's little or no time to give the characters any character , with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children 's father is especially clich d and then when they 're back on BLAMMO ! it 's something else Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly In fairness , Jerry O'Connell , Jordana Brewster , Jeremy Sisto , Julia Stiles and Charles S Dutton give their material the old college try , but they 're wasted \( especially the latter two \) it 's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton , and Rosanna Arquette \( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 \) is always welcome br br What is n't welcome is how The '60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect \( and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post 60s America never mentions the British Invasion no Beatles , no Rolling Stones then again , there 's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album , right \? \) Capping its surface skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending , American Dreams and The Wonder Years did it all much , much better Nothing to see here you ca n't see elsewhere , people except for Julia Stiles doing the twist , that is 
This is one of the worst action films I have ever seen This is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility \( like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one \) , the cheap sets \( the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon \) , and the bad acting It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus However , the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box , does so at the same time a bank heist is going down , at the same FBI agents have been informed of this , and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts Needless to say , the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one However , the results do not make for an enticing action film , but instead , one that has been obviously z grade junk from the beginning of the film \( Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film \) What the hell Ron Perlman was doing in this , I have no idea I wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as I was to have watched it 
I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time , after seeing Return to Paradise , which I found to be gritty I was so disappointed The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which I think was partly stolen from Return to Paradise br br Maybe I was expecting too much br br On the positive side Danes , Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles Although I didnt like Danes 's character and first and found her very annoying br br I couldnt see anything realistic about the film It could of been done so much better , for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror It was too cheery a movie to be realistic There could also of been more action and tension br br The best thing about this film is the tragic ending I couldnt of predicted that But by that time I really didnt care what happened to them br br 3 10
Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they 're two different mediums Do you think it 's a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play \? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping Blimey there 's thousands of them out there Great movie and a bad stage play br br In order for a stage play to make great cinema there 's two essentials needed br br 1 \) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry br br 2 \) Great dialogue br br On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles The story revolves around a hit man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which ca n't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny Since the story is very static it 's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe , including Germany , Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era Nuremberg \( and a lot of forgotten trials all over Europe \) was a revenge and injustice of the winners What do you think , why were not any American , British , French or Soviet defendants after the WWII \? There were no American , British etc war crimes \? There were no Hiroshima , no Nagasaki , no Tokyo , no Dresden , no Hamburg , no Berlin , no Katyn and so on \? The Germans had war crimes too , but in Nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration The main point was Vae victis ! Germany must perish ! \( That was also a book title in America , 1941 \) br br This film is an awful , ignoble American brainwashing instrument , full of error , lie , propaganda , prejudice and injustice And first of all full of hypocrisy But not surprisingly Why was n't enough the Nuremberg process itself \? This film is a nightmare Total darkness after 60 years ! This darkness \( and hate and narcissism and lack of self criticism \) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea , Vietnam , Cambodia , Serbia , Iraq and so forth And there are no American war criminals Bravo , America ! Very clever Even Stalin would become envious of it 
Me neither , but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful , which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time There 's nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie , and My Name is Modesty Whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level It 's full of B actors but is n't any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously It sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing up drama , flashback style The beautiful Alexandra Staden , smothered beyond recognition under makeup , more resembles a cast member from Top Model than Modesty Blaise I'm not one of those die hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitch perfect in fact I 've never even read Modesty Blaise all I wanted was a decent movie to watch But this was n't it The film feels half finished , with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot It also takes its audience for idiots , explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago \( I guess they think we all have Alzheimers \) br br Now I love a good B movie what 's better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a Calzone \? and Modesty is directed by none other than Scott Spiegel , who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick From Dusk Till Dawn 2 Texas Blood Money ! I loved From Dusk Till Dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad B movie should bring to the table nudity , gore , guns , you name it Modesty is just dull The flashback concerning Modesty 's life is n't interesting The acting is n't bad enough to be laughed at In fact , I kinda liked Nikolaj Coaster Waldau 's \( hey buddy , pseudonyms are your friends ! \) performance as the baddie br br So overall it 's just lame Weak Uninspired Call it what you will Do n't watch anything because Tarantino presents it , people This is just a very forgettable , half hearted thriller , and it never tries to be more than that Allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun \( seriously , even I'm cringing \) My Name Is Modesty A Modesty Waste of Time 4 10
The 1980s TV show , updated with fresh female flesh , and raunchy language The Dukes of Hazzard passed me by it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California or , I probably would have watched Still , from somewhere \( like the clips accompanying this film 's updated 2005 release \) , I knew it was about a fast , orange Dodge Charger and , the General Lee is still good to go br br Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville \( as Bo and Luke Duke \) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage Beautiful Jessica Simpson \( as Daisy \) fills her skimpy short well but , even her arousing pink bikini ca n't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing , topless coeds The too stupid plot involves a graying Burt Reynolds \( as Boss Hogg \) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip mine br br The Dukes of Hazzard \( 7 27 05 \) Jay Chandrasekhar Seann William Scott , Johnny Knoxville , Jessica Simpson , Burt Reynolds
Bottom of the barrel , unimaginative , and practically unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse by far ! Bad acting , dialog , effects , dubbing , pacing , action sequences The list goes on and on Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior rip offs in the early 80 's , some good , some bad This is the worst by far , no contest Not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable , the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half There was 1 \( one \) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie , and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding But EVERYTHING else about this movie seriously reeks ! For actual post nuke fun , go track down a copy of ENDGAME , AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK , or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead They 're much more enjoyable than this rubbish 
Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they 're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves br br This film is set in Glasgow \( although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent \) The premise , about people who 's lives are going nowhere , who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs , COULD have made for a really funny , insightful , quirky , cultish film Instead we have a group of self obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I'm suprised it has n't been banned X and Y are friends X is sleeping with Z Y sleeps with Z as well Oh you figure it out br br A total waste of time Painful dialogue it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project The female character was completely superfluous just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it br br If you 're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it a right laff Everyone else , run , do n't walk away from this sorry little misfit br br And one question , when the group left the boring seaside town \( Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film \) , to go back to Glasgow , WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England \? 
Ok , I wrote a scathing review b c the movie is awful As I was waiting another review \( for Derrida \) of mine to pop up , i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie Look at all the positive reviews They ALL , I say ALL , come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one Crimminy ! and wait till you to the rosebud sic review br br Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for Oh , shoot ! , they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director Holy Window Wipers Batman br br Joe , Tony , you suck as writers , and tony , you could n't direct out of a bad script No jobs for you ! br br ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE ! 
I gave this movie a 2 , and though I consider myself a science fiction fan , I found this movie very difficult to take seriously It was on AMC one late night , and I'm glad I saw it for free This movie is probably good for a few laughs , but not much more br br The special effects are about average for the time period not awful , but not great , either Of course we know more about Mars now than we did back then , but we really ca n't hold that against this film The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story br br There were several parts of this movie that I wish would have been explored in a little more detail the astronaut 's injury condition , the city on Mars , the creature in the lake , etc Overall , the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits complete with a cheesy ending 
Sorry Fulci fans , but I could not get through this one The soundtrack was about as annoying as they come , the acting was puerile , the story has been done and done , and the direction was non existent br br Massacre honestly looked like a children 's film project But I 've seen some of those , and they actually look better than this did ! It appears to have been so underfunded they could n't afford ANYTHING ! Not a DoP , not a director , no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was It was a very poor cinematic experience one of my worst br br This was about the worst suck fest I 've seen , next to Terror Toons which is second only to Killer Klowns from Outer Space I 've nothing else to say about it br br It rates a 0 1 10 from br br the Fiend 
Just think , it cost a total of 250 , 000 to make Clerks How the hell did they spend 45 Million to make this glorified music video \? A practically unknown cast , two or three sets , no special effects that I could see I know , it must have been spent on that expertly crafted , economical , tension filled screenplay Shoot , that bar set must have cost a bundle Anyway , I guess Jerry Bruckheimer would n't be caught dead producing anything for less I'm just surprised he did n't blow up anything br br Anyway , it was n't an awful film I guess The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for 5 Million without any loss to the production , and 6 more 5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well 
This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one And I'm Jewish br br Anbody go to journalism school \? Read an editorial \? Freshman year rhetoric \?

Despite the \( English \) title , this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher 's Stone wants gold made from lead \( virgin 's blood \) Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood He 's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he 's employed and it 's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession \( unfortunately \) There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks , and the film at least has a good look to it , but otherwise there 's little about this to recommend Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all , and most unusual , for a Molina Naschy film , not really any unintentional humor Therefore , 4 out of 10 
There 's been a vogue for the past few years for often as not ironic zombie related films , as well as other media incarnations of the flesh eating resurrected dead Fido is a film that 's either an attempt to cash in on that , simply a manifestation of it , or both and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped , squeaky clean , alternate history \( we are in the wake of a great Zombie War , and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves \) version of a 1950s suburb br br It 's a moderately funny concept on its own , and enough perhaps for a five minute comedy sketch , but it ca n't hold up a feature film on its own The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again , and loses all effectiveness The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders The word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh br br The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here ca n't help but irritate me It is so stylized , in it evidently Pleasantville inspired way , that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 There is something obnoxiously sneering about it , as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open , down to Earth , and superior the 2000s are br br Because the characters are such broad representations of pop culture 1950s types , it 's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her Helen is obsessed with appearances , and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father but they remain quite two dimensional Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie , who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak br br There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around to commodity fetishism , racism , classism , war paranoia , et cetera , but none of it really works on a comprehensive level , and the filmmakers don t really stick with anything br br Unfortunately , this film does n't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of Look !

Sort of family parody blending An Officer And A Gentleman , Heartbreak Ridge , Full Metal Jacket \( and without doubt other movies I am not able to remember now \) into a rather dull movie , with some bright spots The gags are always there where you would expect them , and Damon Wayans 's lines are , well , predictable As I said , unfortunately this movie never surprises you 
It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America 's most notorious serial killers , but sadly it does n't even come close Terrible editing , direction , bad acting , you name it This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father , but that 's not nearly enough to save this stinker A 1 out of 10 
This could have been a very good film , if I had been able to watch it The hand held camera was very bouncy From the opening credits I was worried Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film , giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it The acting seemed very authentic Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand , but a theater full of non South Africans seemed to find most of it funny If you get motion sickness at all though , you may seriously consider skipping this film It 's quaint , but not worth the nausea 
This movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely However the reason the movie is so predictable is that we 've seen it all before I 've have n't read the book A Mother 's Gift but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears sake it is completely different than this movie Unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea , the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized 
Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies br br You 'd think that after such dismal flicks Superstar , Night at the Roxbury , and Coneheads , he 'd start to get the notion that maybe he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to movies \( and many would argue that he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to television , as well \) Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense br br I personally like Tim Meadows , and think that he would be great in the right movie It 's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation , and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad , not because it 's funny br br Oh well , at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films done about them It 's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen 
Well , Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay But , although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion \( I am an atheist \) , it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end Why is this movie so incredibly boring \? I do n't know It just is and so it is not recommendable 
I picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious The Gamers by Dead Gentlemen Productions \( which is highly recommendable , by the way \) Boy , what a disappointment ! The movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver The reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing True , it can be funny to use every singe clich there is about role playing games , but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable Already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about But maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top There is no subtlety in this movie , if there would be captions LAUGH NOW or a cheap 80s style fake laughter track it would not make much difference With some scenes you ca n't help to think Yea , I get why they thought this would be funny but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke 
I wanted to like this film , yes its a SAW , blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good , not brilliant , but good film unfortunately those ingredients had gone off ! The acting was terrible , and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one \( hoods taken off \) , the remarks and one liners are just terrible , yes I know , bad writing but this is more than that , it was bad writing coupled with bad acting Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film br br Sorry , Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all br br I will end with PLOT HOLES , PLOT HOLES MORE PLOT HOLES ! DISAPPOINTING ! 
This is one of those films that I could only sit through once Charlotte Henry is fine in fact , all the actors were fine The problem was in the script , the dialog , the direction , the editing , the sets and the special effects Granted , this was 1933 , but it really creaked Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen , Gary Cooper , W C Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable \( there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming \) The movie just clumped along with no cohesion Much of Lewis Carrols spirit , humor and continuity are missing What a pity ! It 's such a great book I would recommend Disney 's 1951 version 
This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely African American cast Every derogatory , disparaging stereotype of the black American community is featured prominently I wo n't reinforce the insults by listing them here , except to mention chickens , watermelons , and dice br br One good song by Ethel Waters \( and a couple of bad ones \) , and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8 year old Sammy Davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the IMDb scale 
Higher Learning says its OK for blacks to torment white people because they 're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race Incompetent acting , direction , and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick An appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed Higher Learning says its OK for blacks to torment white people because they 're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race Incompetent acting , direction , and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick An appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed 
In case half of this film 's footage looks strangely familiar , it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult crap ! For you see , the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie , he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own \( and more easily traceable \) Cat in the Brain The opening scene already , in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe , features in Fulci 's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments Andrea Bianchi 's Masssacre fails miserably as a giallo , since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful , but it 's still good entertainment if you 're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who 're all potential maniacs , but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast Whenever there is n't any bloodshed on screen , like between the first and second murder , Massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography Thankfully in the second half , there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned Cat in the Brain That one features ALL the great moments of Massacre , and then some 
I was n't really hoping for much when I went to see this After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though , I was hoping for a similar experience here br br Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously Do I care about Jason 's problems \? I'm sorry no There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway At at then end of the day , he 's an undead serial killer , I'm just not going to get that sympathetic br br Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not , but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie , it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch only not funny br br 
Admittedly , I watched this piece with already VERY low expectations Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego br br This was the first cartoon movie that I watched that was 100 per cent humor free It is rude , offensive , redneck and blatantly anti women As such , it is a creation befitting Bohlen , but the average viewer will be rather put off by it No wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater It would 've bombed BIG time ! br br Not even the expense of 6 5 MegaEuros were able to save this utter piece of crap Save your time and money ! 
Would n't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all of these stupid , pointless , I'm getting more sex than you are teen movies \? In a perfect world , yes Yet this one is even worse This one is not humiliating for the stars , it 's humiliating for the distributor All of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have NO interest in seeing , yet it 's funny Devon Sawa , who was actually good in Final Destination , is just plain dull in this movie It makes you wonder if it 's being bad on purpose Grade F
The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene Jim Watch your ass Nick You watch yours \( together \) I wont leave you behind ! br br The first action sequence shows how awful the production is , but its really kind of funny Good guys have transformer weapons ! In one scene , they all have fake HK MP5 sub machine guns Next scene , AK 47 replicas ! And then , to top it all off , they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M 16s ! ! I think they had a budget shortage for guns , not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell You have to remove the pin spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own You ca n't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter Weapons that you throw away do n't suddenly re appear When a gun is out of bullets , throwing it away is still pretty stupid Unless you have no idea how to reload them Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes I really cant believe movies like this are actually produced This movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk 
Ummm , please forgive me , but were n't more than half the characters missing \? In the original novel , Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector Javert Along the way there are MANY characters that were n't in this version Some worth mentioning would be Fantine , Cosette , M Mme Thenardier , Eponine , Marius , Gavroche , and Enjolras The only character with the same name is Javert I was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie , trying to see how it was in any way connected to Victor Hugo 's epic novel 
The premise is amazing and the some of the acting , notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp , is charming but this film is near unwatchable The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap Most of the singing is off key I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it The dialogue is really stupid and trite The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end '
It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter , Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn They looked quite wonderful But that was it They were not given any characters or good lines to work with I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing br br Some of the smaller female roles were fine , Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts They showed some talent and it is sad they did n't go on to star in more and better films Sadly , I did n't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role br br The film appears to have some fans , and I was very open minded when I started watching it I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie , Cat 's Meow and all his early ones from Targets to Nickleodeon So , it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one br br It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other Five years later , Bogdanovich 's ex girlfriend , Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called Moonlighting stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich Of course , there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue , while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines br br Bottom line It ai n't no Paper Moon and only a very pale version of What 's Up , Doc 
A young couple Mandy Pullman \( Mitch Martin \) and Roy Seeley \( Matt Birman \) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other Mandy hides in an old run down cabin , she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed Dr Sam Cordell \( John Cassavetes \) and his daughter Jenny \( Erin Flannery \) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam 's wife Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden \( John Ireland \) when Mandy and Roy are found He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis \( Denise Furgusson \) is also attacked and raped A local journalist named Laura Kincaid \( Kerrie Keane \) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier More rapes and murders occur Meanwhile Jenny 's boyfriend Tim Galen \( Duncan MacIntosh \) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts Tim 's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus a shape shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce ! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I 've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes , but none are shown on screen There is only one gore scene in the entire film too The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes Everything about this film production wise is very static and flat , the film has no energy or pace The acting is dull and you do n't feel or care for anyone Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions The type of rubbish horror film making that you 'll forget within a day A real waste of time , do n't bother 
When I was seventeen I genuinely believed Elvis to be the king of rock and roll , and not only did I wish to see all 31 of his character movies , but it was my ambition to own them , too What an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen year old I must have been Thankfully sense prevailed and Live A Little , Love A Little is the only Elvis film I own br br The spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song A Little Less Conversation has been released as a single \( His first to reach the UK top ten in 22 years his first UK No 1 in 25 \) Even when I was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help I realised that the songs for this movie were n't exactly first rate However , A Little Less Conversation rollnecks and 60s grooving aside is a real standout Finding a lesser known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions It 's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated , but it 's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult \( And what chauvinistic lyrics , too Though what other Elvis song contains the word procrastinate \? \) br br But what really bothers me about this film is not A Little Less Conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it Actually based on a novel \( Kiss My Firm But Pliant Lips what kind of lame novel would that be \? \) this one sees a bored Elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho Within 90 seconds of meeting him , Michele Carey asks would you like to make love to me \? Quite a fast mover by any standards I'm sure you 'll agree br br I do seem to recall that some of Elvis 's early movies most notably Jailhouse Rock and King Creole were n't too bad , but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers Being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts , causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh , and models dress as pink mermaids There 's even a dream sequence for God 's sake Maybe the only dumb stereotype it does n't conform to is in not having all that many songs With just four to choose from , including the credits number , you 're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks Some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes , but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain Of the remaining three tracks , then The Edge of Reality is n't actually that bad , though Elvis 's dance to it must surely have been called The Bear Trap br br In one sense , for a PG certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content Sadly , however , with talking dogs , Middle America sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you 'll ever see , Elvis 's dignity is obliterated by this movie 
 spoliers do not read any further if you have n't seen this movie br br Picking up after the depressing Phantasm II ended The Tall Man kidnaps Mike , while Reggie and new kid Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back , and not end up as slaves on the Tall Man 's Red Planet This one gets really silly the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse were only there for comic relief , and the black karate chick \( ca n't remember her name \) was so irritating I could n't wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character This one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be Tim 's character , who comes in late and ultimately is the hero , but it does n't quite work out that way By the very end of this story Liz is beheaded by the killer midgets , Mike gets a silver sphere implanted into his skull , the spheres get Reggie and the dwarfs get Tim , and there 's no one left to stop The Tall Man The bad guy wins now how 's that for a surprise twist at the end \? br br This was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95 , and the ending of this one was at the time final , and although it 's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series But the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes , and an even worse and more nonsensical ending br br 1 2 out of 
I had a video of the thing And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep It 's slow moving , and the idea of a mid Atlantic platform , which may have been revolutionary at the time , is now just a great big yawnaroony Apart from Conrad Veidt , the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable , and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting When the water started to spill big time it even , on one occasion , woke me up br br But give the man his due No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt He does n't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals He holds it in his fingers , while showing us the old pearly browns There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke 
I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued A woman , who one day sees herself drive past in her own car Well , I thought , this could be interesting br br but it is n't First , the title The Broken \? The Broken what \? What is broken \? The oh , wait I get it , the title itself is broken ! WOW , clever ! Unfortunately , this is virtually the only thing going for it br br The premise is not that bad , but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors' A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors , and a rather mediocre one at that A more suited title would be 'The Boring' , since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages Or maybe 'The Confusing' since it does n't explain anything at all , not in the narrative nor in the story itself , only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch , dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death , but nothing tangible It 's just messed up br br On the other hand , the acting and the special effects are quite good , but then again , it 's not a difficult role to act br br After watching the movie twice , I still feel unsatisfied , a little confused maybe , and not in the E A Poe or Stephen King kind of way Do yourself a favor , and do n't watch this one Simply put , there are better thrillers out there 
I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short Surviving Desire in high school , and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant Henry Fool But this 10 year later sequel is not only unnecessary , it 's disgraceful br br After a choppy and expeditious start , Fay Grim devolves into pseudo intellectualism , flat out boredom , and finally unwarranted and unwanted nihilism And that 's just the plot br br The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the movie one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself , and it 's his only spoken scene in the film ! br br Jeff Goldblum 's Agent Fulbright , it seems , is the only bright character \( a pun surely intended by Hartley as well \) How , then , is he left \? SPOILER Dead via a car bombing , easily making this the gentle natured Hartley 's most violent film to date , and tonally all wrong in a film that 's already all wrong from the word go br br As for the other new characters , Angus James , Ned Fool \( or is it Grim \? \) , not to mention Fay herself well , I wo n't spoil their fates , as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own \( when it is n't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle , which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student \) br br This piece is a complete disaster , a dreadful mess that is n't even good humored enough to revel in its messiness Instead it self indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world , one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say In doing so , Hartley tracks sh t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them br br I have rarely been so depressed at the movies , and I'm counting Leaving Las Vegas , which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them , instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved br br Grim , indeed 
This piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago , but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the Native American Indians played by white men The right wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life , just like his close friend John Wayne In 1971 Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from The Jimmy Stewart Show \( a short lived series that mercifully flopped \) just because Williams was black As if that were not bad enough , this film is very dated and boring Watch Dances with Wolves instead for a less racist view br br Stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made , and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16 year old Debra Paget I'm surprised it was even allowed br br 0 10 
I cannot stand this show ! Has there ever been even one redeeming quality , one funny punchline , or one plot line that did n't make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes \? br br The voices Oh , those horrible , wretched voices Akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard , each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill , nasal vocals Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel , Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew , and Timmy 's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host \( Guy Smiley from Sesame Street comes to mind \) br br The animation is awful even the producers of Yu Gi Oh ! laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show Every character has buck teeth , or a square head , or a head three sizes too big for his or her body And what 's with having the characters speak every single line wide eyed and grinning , as though posing for a photo op with the president \? Then , there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia , Homer Simpson , and Buddy Lembeck of Charles in Charge fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb Usually unrealistic is synonymous with unfunny , and that is most definitely the case here There has n't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since The Naked Gun 33 1 3 and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it br br Finally , the premise of the show \( and it 's the same every single episode , so big time spoiler alert here \) Timmy wishes for something with his two Fairly Oddparents , something goes wrong , there 's always some contrived reason why he ca n't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage , and then everything turns out just fine in the end Oh , and on a side note , Timmy 's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky , and they continue to employ her at every opportunity Maybe it 's just me , but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably is n't a great idea br br If you 're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen , The Fairly Odd Parents has to be a great place to start A prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it 
In what could have been an otherwise run of the mill , mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties \( the subtle free love period \) , the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top , happily ever after ending At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life , nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber The story line plods along slowly to its predictable , pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless Here 's a hint , it occurs about 30 minutes into the film Fast forward to that part and skip the rest 
The plot for Descent , if it actually can be called a plot , has two noteworthy events One near the beginning one at the end Together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time Everything \( and I mean everything \) in between is basically the director 's desperate effort to fill in the minutes I like disturbing movies , I like dark movies and I do n't get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy dark \( literally \) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming Rosario Dawson , one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here And no , she does n't get naked , not even in the NC 17 version , which I saw br br If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch Descent , take a nap instead you 'll probably have more interesting dreams 
Perhaps I missed the meeting when the meaning of B movie was explained , but what I just saw was ridiculous You want a good synopsis of this movie \? Take Aliens , replace the xenomorphs with vampires , then remove everything that was good about it , and that 's pretty much it br br 5 minutes into the movie , the V SAN squad \( that 's the dumbest acronym I 've ever heard \) checks out a base thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down \( DOWN \?

Pretty much the only thing original about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is br br Watching this afterbirth of a film , the only amusement I got was from the feeble attempts at set making Since when does taping PCI computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship \? The money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use 
What was Steven Seagal thinking \? I mean firstly I love Seagal I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s His early stuff is some of the best in the genre This however does not live up to its excellent name Attack Force \( with protagonist Marshall Lawson Seagal \) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form However , what we get is a crime mystery , bordering on a political thriller with little or no action Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight I could not follow this story There 's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug What happened in this movie The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace , a shambles and a shame Why dub the man \? The story is terrible This got a 2 10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him , and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera ! Revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie well forget revenge Steven , you need redemption ! 
An offensively over the top action adventure , FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it 's release in the mid 80 's , with right wing Reaganism and virulent anti red feelings still not finished yet , though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the 'Evil Empire' in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism br br In that sense , we can be most grateful to 'Gorby' , not for his disarmament treaties with the US , nor his policies of 'glasnost' , or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Union 's backyard No , it 's the final diminution of foolish , jingoistic , bloated cold war adventures like this The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect , though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline In this sequel , any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly , senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo single handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POW 's ten years after the conflict ended , with the Americans on the losing side br br Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy they may have lost the war , but there was still unfinished business at hand , and ludicrous comic strip heroics with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight , with as much hardware as possible , fulfilled such whimsically far fetched ideals br br This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMAN SPIDERMAN level , but sadly everything is played absolutely straight But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind The action scenes , though technically adequate , never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness , because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts namely , our hero Rambo is always unscathed \( aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there \) despite the tons of explosives , grenades , gunshots , etc going around him br br In between the mayhem , what there is of a script consists of the dullest clich s and banalities Stallone , who co wrote the script with James Cameron \( a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year \) , deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English , and merely comes out with moronic grunts , almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character ! In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did ! The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given , and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGB Red Army villain roles Berkoff 's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoff 's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags \? Well , credibility is never this film 's strong point It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy , and an immortal classic it turned out to be This is only a classic of the most dismal , and indeed offensive , kind And as for Sly 's climactic speech , rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people , eh \? By the way , in the same year , he also made ROCKY IV br br RATING 3 out of 10 
WOW ! br br I just was given this film from a friend of mine , who bought it for 1 98 at Walmart , and he felt that he got taken ! It is beyond boring , most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen , the acting is somewhat improvised , almost as if they did n't have a script The Martians are CGI , which look like they were done by a novice , or a Fan produced movie I cannot stress just how bad this DVD really is ! br br Example In one of the scenes , the martians are torturing a local female captive She goes from a woman in front of a green screen , to a CGI copy of that woman The change is totally noticeable , and when she is killed , you can see that it is a computer figure , looking like something from a game back in 1990 ! br br If at all possible , avoid this movie like the plague ! You can download two trailers from their site , and see how god awful it really is ! 
I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise But , no , that 's really what it was And since the film was only about 27 minutes long , I decided to give it a try If it had turned out to be some porno movie , I would have stopped watching Instead , it turned out to be the most bizarre film I have ever seen The Danish production crew tried , with a budget of about 49 , to make a Star Trek style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women like they proceeded to do on the Earth ! And in every case , they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet br br Subtle , this ai n't With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I 've ever heard , I do n't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed ! However , despite the utter crappiness of it all , it was strangely watchable and worth a peek But , as I mentioned already , due to the crude names and odd subject matter \( though no nudity \) , it 's a film for adults only br br By the way , this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this , WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience \? ! It may not be the absolute worst thing I have ever seen , but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive ! 
What the hell is this \? Its one of the dumbest movies I 've seen I do n't understand why people on this site love it so much Its senseless nudity for no reason Its worst then Resident Evil I strongly do n't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy , bad acting crap Watch real horor movies such as Stephen King 's It , The Shining , Jurassic Park \( kinda horor \) , JAWS , etc Leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent It is bad as Crudy vs Gayson Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better then this crap br br Oh wow flesh eating zombies How many damn zobie movies do we need SKip this one br br outta 
I saw not so fabulous rating on IMDb , but I went to see it anyway , because I am a big fan of Bible related material First thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie , but it also looked like Casper Van Dien did n't see those Jones movies through \( but he should \) I believe he tried his best , but script just stunk Music tried to be kinda Jones style too Great work , but for such movie it seemed like too much work , like the video part did't deserve all that great music Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills , he did a good job , but somehow the script was bringing everything down Jokes are old school , somewhere 20 years old they brought only cynic smile to my face There are some really bad camera angels , SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic Kevin VanHook had probably a good idea on the story \( in my opinion , but I love such stories \) , but things just did n't work out in the end Maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head When I \( in first minutes \) saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies' , I hoped that I will at least 'hear' a good story , but sometimes movies just disappoint 
The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are , and who the characters are And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand , i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept br br I hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are , which date we are at , and especially what the characters feel and think I believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience br br But after the bad influencing intro , a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way I think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations For example , a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first , but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well I think the director is a very good observer about real life br br But that is it After a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story telling I really felt like I'm having a big headache because of the non stop talking characters It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs It is realistic really , but characters always asking really , is that so etc to each other , or characters saying no or are you listening to me , ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache br br I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot , but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes 
Okay Who was it \? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10 \? Are you tripping of your head on Ecstasy pipes \? There were so many of you Did you do it for a dare \? Is this some kind of cult \? Or did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times under different names \? br br Before I say anything else , I 'll say this Just because you do n't understand a film does n't mean that it 's not great Maybe you 've had a bad day at work , or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then were n't in the mood Maybe there 's a more fundamental stumbling block like you just do n't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it BUT And this is a very , very big but The XXL elephant sized mega but to end all buts br br PLEASE do n't confuse incoherence for complexity , and please do n't confuse this two hour non squirter for an interesting film Really You may think you are pretty smart You may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep like naysayers Please do n't You 're embarrassing yourself br br Revolver 's a waste of everyone 's time If you thought about if for a few minutes , you 'd recognise it too It was a waste of the cast , a waste of the crew , a waste of the caterers , and definitely a waste of the precious minutes \( you ca n't get them back you know \) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable , wretched mess br br No wait , comes a voice in the darkness You just do n't understand Its NON LINEAR That means the story does n't go in a STRAIGHT LINE This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions And anyway they slated FIGHT CLUB when it first came out did n't you hear \? Because they could n't deal with the COMPLEXITY They 're eating humble pie now Bet you hate Lynch films too , doncha \? br br Hate to disappoint you , but I am quite a big Lynch fan I rather like Memento , so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion does n't necessarily fill me with fear And although I 've only studied it briefly a few years ago , philosophy interests me greatly I do n't dislike Revolver for these reasons I dislike it because it purports to be about weighty , big brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable I'm not much of a chess player , but Richie 's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old I dislike it because the characters , without exception , totally alienated me Aha ! cries the Richie apologist Guy is cleverly tipping his hat to Brecht ! Just maybe you 're right I think its more likely that he just ca n't write a decent script for toffee br br Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually really instructive Fight Club has acid tongued , nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh Revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one liners that make your ears bleed Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened Revolver has , as far as I can tell , several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because well , they do n't make sense If you keep pulling the rug out from under people , they eventually kick you out of their house And then they lock all the doors and windows And they never let you back in Ever br br Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz phrases Mostly they are spoken , but often they flash up on the screen with attributions It 's almost pathological br br But what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clich s in the world Ultimately its so inconsequential You do n't care about anything You do n't understand anything You go home br br Actually , there was a bit I really liked the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence He 's great But I ca n't recommend you see the film just to see him He 's only in it for a few minutes br br Please believe me It 's horrible 
There are some great philosophical questions What is the purpose of life \? What happens when we die \? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD \? \? \? The premise is absurd Thre acting is one dimensional The special effects are overdone And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced But then , if they had been good shots , everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie Too bad it did n't happen that way Tempted to turn it off several times , I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get Glad I did because \( SPOILER \? \) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey , dismal scenario It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive in in off season Apart from the general awfulness of the film , I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale ! 
I picked this DVD up at the Dollar Store The DVD was on the 2 for 1 rack , but since it had Michael Madsen in it , I thought that since I had never seen the movie , I bought it anyway br br I must say that I did n't like the movie The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else I found that the director 's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order br br I wo n't throw it away like one of the other commentators , but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again br br Who knows , since it was Michael Madsen 's film debut , maybe it might have some archival value at some future date 
This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap Do n't waste your time watching this Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 \) Avoid this movie by all means ! 
I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable Judge for yourself Be warned , the following will not only give away the plot , but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie br br A computer virus , designed by a frustrated nerd , sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors When the code in the form of light enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck , develops tunnel vision , his skin will turn white of the calcium , after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk br br This virus is very intelligent When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device operated by hands the device is set on a very high voltage , which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert 's head The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc 's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water br br Oh dear 
I 'll keep this short as a movie like this does n't deserve a full review br br Given the setting , this movie could have been something really special It could have been another 28 days later or even a Blair Witch Project br br The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited , directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense , although I do n't think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty London Underground br br Characters were a big let down Our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap , and you really do n't care if she dies or not As many people have said before , I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy , who managed to give me a chuckle or two \( whether intentional of the writers or not \) br br The main villain , is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie , but when he is revealed I was really disappointed I wo n't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match br br All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark br br Just to highlight how lame this movie was , the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY 
In 1987 , John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes , Trains and Automobiles' , which was a hilarious and poignant comedy the best thing he 's ever done Ten years on he 's reduced to again recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' in this second sequel , which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic The four crooks that 's right , four ! And one of them is a girl ! Congratulations , Hughes , for introducing this revolutionary change to the series ! are electrocuted with metal chairs , brained with barbells and blinded with paint , ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha , while the new kid is even less charming than Culkin You 'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilising the same old routines , but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'Home Alone 4' 
Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise a young Mafia would to be killer \( Chandler \) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to California to take some lessons with a very known professional killer \( Beluschi \) First and most important task to kill a young woman \( Lee \) that is a completely strange for all of them But is she a easy target \? The movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie Good performance by Chandler I give this a 4 \( four \) 
I had high hopes for it when I heard that it was being made back in 2001 because I read The Devil and Daniel Webster when I was a kid and I found it very interesting They made some changes to the story that do n't make much sense to me Daniel Webster in the story was a famous lawyer from New Hampshire in the story In the movie he is an editor A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil him herself \( he was a man in the story , but was a woman in the movie \) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line As an editor , it does n't seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this br br The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd These are two actors that I like , they just did an awful job in this movie It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy , but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind , and was then re edited by somebody else Given this fact , it 's surprising that it was at all coherent I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie , which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy br br All in all I would have to say it was n't completely awful , but it was n't much good If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it , I would The ending was especially disappointing As in the original story , Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie literally , we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez , and then the movie abruptly ends It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained , so who is to say he did n't just repeat his mistakes over again , and perhaps over and over in an endless loop \? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense The decent cast , and the acting of everyone except for Baldwin and Aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich

It 's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in Rabbit Test So , as a small contribution to this future effort , I 'd like to suggest this word br br Hubiriffic \( adj \) A combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific' used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film Rabbit Test br br Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have severely over reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82 minute festival of wretchedness Trying to put together an Airplane ! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags , \( Note to Joan German doctors have n't been funny since Vaudeville \) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills that 's is bad enough But compounding this cinematic crime is River 's directorial style , which can best be described as 'ugly' , and a cast of once and future has beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags br br Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the film 's hapless protagonist Lionel Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face br br I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test Cabbages , mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates But for self aware , thinking humans I 'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before I 'd recommend Rabbit Test 
I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection , and one night I just decided to watch it though not expecting much As the beginning credits roll around I'm surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as Troll 2 , Ator the Invincible , and Quest for the Mighty Sword , so I was compelled to watch br br As the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent , even though it was unoriginal The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent But after a while into the film , the pace started dragging and I found myself thinking Okay someone better get killed soon , or Someone better mutate At the onset of this drag , when I was having these thoughts , though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated , however as noted , the gore and effects were n't very good What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first Dr Houseman would be at the Zoo , then he 'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone , finally he 'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask Was he dreaming he was at the zoo \? Like the movie 's pace , these scene transitions got progressively worse br br I could try to say the character development of Dr Houseman was pretty good , but towards the end of the film , that is , once you 've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into , hopefully you 'll laugh which really , is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a long winded joke br br The costume of the um , thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D' Amato 's Quest for the Mighty Sword , which was made in the same year You 've gotta love Filmirage movies , they 're always re using the same stuff ! 
The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps , accidents and destruction , mostly caused by Stan , but with Ollie receiving the bulk \( ! \) of the punishment see the great 'The Music Box' \( 1933 \) or 'Towed in a Hole' \( 1932 \) as some some classic examples br br Here , however , for some reason \( is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan 's father \? \) the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations It does n't come off It 's merely another third rate tedious 30s comedy , heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures \( Ollie 's finger wiggling , Stan 's blank stares , etc \) or comic abilities br br The film begins with them running from the police Since we never see or know why , it 's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught , and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot 's mansion The premise for the 'humor' , Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging They are not playing 'Stan and Ollie' in this film Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor br br Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny , but he does n't get the chance to do any of that here He 's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot , but none of it rises much above the silly We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree 's name , the Call me a cab ! Okay you 're a cab ! joke , cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns , and a non sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two , and James Finlayson is still doing his silent era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks br br Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'Sons of the Desert' \( 1933 \) where we get to see them do what we love about them be themselves In fact , 1932 34 seem to be their best years br br Since this film does not play to any of their strengths , why bother with it \?

Exceedingly complicated and drab I'm a bright guy , but this was just too much for a tired brain It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing Probably better for the US market GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why br br Still the sand dunes are pretty The nail pulling is nasty The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery The cricket is good to see br br Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this , despite it being over 2 hours long Thank heavens they shortened it Admittedly we do n't get to the pictures much , but the last film we saw , Walk the Line , was 10 times better and I do n't really like Johnny Cash My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there 's that am I nearly there yet \? br br How about now
First To Die 2003 br br I 'll admit my mistake first I did n't realize this was a made for TV movie I was thrown off by the R certification The plot is strong , but the movie is about 40 minutes too long The direction and continuity were excellent For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters The down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the chick flick genre Although there are some violent scenes , none of the violence should call for an R rating There is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes Actually , there are no sex scenes Ona Grauer \( who is absolutely beautiful \) , Kristina Copeland , Sonya Salomaa , and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG 1 series , but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses Robert Patrick was fantastic , as he usually is and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin The very talented Megan Gallagher who I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series , was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities The greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan Aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive , her voice is absolutely annoying I found myself muting the TV during her dialogue I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV type of programs I would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however Considering I found nothing that would cause censorship , this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on TV , since nothing will be cut out As a TV movie I would rate this as a 5 out 10 As a feature film with an R certification and such as strong cast , I rate it as a 2 out of ten 
I am a big fan of Stephen King I loved The Running Man So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it And when a local network showed the film , I was in heaven I was all ready for a night of fun ! br br The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part , as was described in the book I still was convinced that this would be a good film , however Who knows , maybe Arnold had some hidden talents \? br br Well , he did n't I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin' an' shootin' Yup , it was a standard Arnold film hero is done wrong , hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl br br I was stunned This is NOT what the book said at all I know that books ca n't be put on screen literally , but this did n't even have ties to the book Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film I do n't say it often , but this film was BAD If I were n't at home watching , I 'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen Once again bad br br \( Note that I used 'someone' a lot I did this because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I do n't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here \)

Nine minutes of psychedelic , pulsating , often symmetric abstract images , are enough to drive anyone crazy I did spot a full frame eye at the start , and later some birds silhouetted against other colors It was just not my cup of tea It 's about 8 minutes too long 
It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR Trilogy But this was one of the most awful movies I 've ever seen Bad acting , bad screenplay , bad everything THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION I do n't doubt any second that there are people who 'll like this sense of humor , but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers I'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas At the movies it was a nice \( but no big at all \) success during the first two weeks but then , when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good , the movie dropped very fast In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore In the last ten years , the two worst movies I 've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque I ca n't decide which one was worse , but I'm happy that there a so many good movies so I do n't have to think too much on this question 
A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young , gay , black artist br br If that sounds vague it 's because the movie itself is It 's well directed , fairly well written and \( for the most part \) well acted Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black white Also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes \( not that explicit and no frontal \) Still , I mostly hated this br br The film meanders all over the place , is full of unlikable characters \( including the main protagonist \) and \( this is the killer \) moves at a snails pace Three times I considered leaving the theatre because I was so utterly bored But the director WAS there so I stayed br br His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete I really wish I could like this more \( there are VERY few films dealing honestly with gay blacks \) but I ca n't Unless you 're very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there 's no reason to see this 
The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price I expected a Based on the true story movie only to find a shot on home video hodge podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non related slaughter house scenes The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but , low and behold it only got worse If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one 
Well , I 'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies Still , it was more appealing to me for it 's moral value I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie , Hollywood Shuffle True , he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable , but his movies are still fun br br Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel I always felt that , if there were superheroes , they would n't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems Car broken into , bad neighborhood , local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution , etc The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community br br What I found to be truly entertaining , outside of James Earl Jones' young forever performance , was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers It was n't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him , without his input , of course It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived br br Yes , the plot was weak , the movie was predictable , there was bad acting and continuity was rotten , but it ranks 1 with my kids Robert Townsend works to bring movies home so to speak I doubt he 'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is , but there are and will always be , those that love him for his efforts br br One point to ponder about the film , which I find amusing Throughout the entire battle with Simon , no one bothered to call the police \? \? \? \?

My mother would have been right there , scrapping by my side , toe to toe Dad would be loading his pistol lol br br Rent it and check it out It 's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad , Luther Vandross , Bill Cosby , Big Daddy Kane , etc Great job with the cameos Robert ! 
I saw this director 's Woman On The Beach and could not understand the good to great reviews This film is much like that one , two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else Like his other films , you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog , wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten , pretty uninteresting characters If you feel you can like this film , do n't let my review stop you I do like minimalism in films , but I feel Tsai Ming Liang 's films are far superior He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang Sheng in his films There is nothing here I wish IU liked it , but I do n't Oh , well 
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen , everything about it is weak and incoherent The acting is absurd , the costumes even crummier and the story is non existent This 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that Beastmaster and Conan enjoyed but it does n't give us any reason to follow along The lead character is tepid and dull , he ca n't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th Century All the action sequences are like that , slow and unrealistic , not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse Do n't even bother with this crap 
I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas Having reserved a special slot for it last night , I sat down to watch it with my daughter \( aged 17 and a Film Studies student \) , with chocolates of course , in eager anticipation We love Jane Austin br br After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk The shaky camera shots and angles , general poor cinematography , direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied Despondent , we viewed on br br Anne , played by Sally Hawkins , looked oddly and with no particular purpose , directly at the camera on several occasions , breaking our hard won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'I 'll find you' stalking fashion br br Poor Rupert Penry Jones , who played Captain Wentworth , did his best with the script and direction , bless him I hope they paid him well , however , as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall , drenching him and his co actor They were nearly swept out to sea Health and Safety would have had a field day ! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place br br Other than Mr Penry Jones , Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head 's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott br br Towards the long awaited end of the film , Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being In contrast , Anne ran , hyper ventilating , from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who , in the meantime , had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told , in the course of only three or four minutes , without even having worked up a sweat br br We experienced none of Anne 's charms crossing the screen Indeed , we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain , spineless , opinion less Anne and why someone , anyone , did not tell mean , winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up br br The crucial kiss , normally our favourite girlie moment , was painfully drawn out As they moved in closer , Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met Eww ! br br The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been br br What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story , filmed in some of England 's finest scenery br br Sorry Jane 
Shocking ! br br In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive He was sincere , unpretentious and kindly , he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person In this movie I saw a clown ! The actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry They made a cartoon ! The real Gagarin was someone else ! Do n't believe in this movie ! br br I saw this movie after the movies like Taming of Fire and Apollo 13 and after reading books Rockets and People by Chertok and Korolev Myths and Facts by Golovanov I was shocked by tiresome scenario , poor acting and producing , and a lots of inexactitudes of Space Race br br The movie is the tedious rendering of well known in Russia historical facts A lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated Some facts and details were perverted For example , in 1945 Korolev was already not a prisoner \( liberated in 1944 \) , and in 1940 he was already not in Kolyma prison gold mine , but in special prison design bureau Korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners But in the movie Korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 \( because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform \) IMHO , the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they ca n't to make interesting movies 
The 1960 's were a time of change and awakening for most people Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke out about their views Racial tensions , politics , the Vietnam War , sexual promiscuity , and drug use were all part of the daily fabric , and the daily news This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie , and largely succeeded br br In this film , two families are followed one white , one black During the first half of the film , the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles Unfortunately , the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family Admittedly , there are more characters in this family , and the story lines are intermingled , but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br On the whole , the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie The movie is a work of fiction , but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided 
I'm easily entertained I enjoyed Hot Shots and The Naked Gun and their many sequels , even when most people found them unbearable I 've even managed to enjoy most Pauly Shore movies There is only one movie that I 've seen that I can honestly say was bad and this was it It 's been a while since I 've seen it , but I do remember sitting in the theater thinking , This is a dumb movie Why did I see this \? It 's honestly the only movie that I cannot recommend 
On the surface , this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation , that is how to become a true self by embracing the so called 'dark' side of human nature Thus , we have the Darkling , a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company \( that is , recognition \) of men , and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled , more or less successfully br br However , if we dig a little deeper , we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene , the main character \( male car mechanic fallen from grace \) is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter , when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl Lesson 1 Cars are persons embodied with immortal souls , and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that , another character \( Rubin \) buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman Lesson 2 Just like any other person , a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced In addition , there is the twist that Rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk , but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of Rubin 's own personal greed for more profit Lesson 3 Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only , but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to Rubin and , more importantly , Rubin 's car The main character 's assessment of the car 's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance , but also by a thorough look inside the engine room Lesson 4 A car is not just to be judged by its looks , it is what is inside that really counts There is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind , as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell Rubin a fake collector 's car This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson 3 br br There are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car person' theme , and I am too tired now to bother citing all of them , but the point remains \( and I guess this is what I'm really trying to say \) that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or , if you 're a car devotee 
Well here I go with another B industry movie It 's sad enough to see some badly made films but I do n't care if a B industry or C industry produces the film Show some effort in your work The characters are really bad The acting is n't in question in this one \( surprise \) , but plot is How can a tight knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered , and then go on as if nothing happened What sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor 's ass was Give me a break 
As a big fan of the original film , it 's hard to watch this show The garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake The mood is never there Instead , it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff , but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment do n't fit the mood of the original , or make him an interesting character He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice The English accent and California looks ca n't hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick 's velvet voice and sex appeal Lee J Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes , but even his performance is just gruff , without style br br It feels like the TV movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is 
I am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film br br Often with foreign films I skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming absence of action as many of the best international films do not live up to the Western Hollywood model of cinematic storytelling br br I enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of clich in the foreign film arena I enjoy that many foreign films do n't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow br br That said , this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time I wasted watching it No meaningful character development , no engaging story arc , no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen br br Synopsis A bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves , and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the house boy finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her br br While the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic , this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario I was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it , and I would n't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings br br Unless you have an academic interest in the period I strongly suggest steering clear of this one 
The subject notwithstanding , this is an amateur , exhibitionist movie or an effort at one which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student 's composition book full of death poetry To be sure , it will disturb viewers who are hell bent on being disturbed , but the success will be attributable to themselves , not to the director To genuinely get under somebody 's skin requires sensibility , discipline , technique , and talent , as well as an eye and an ear The film does contain one evocative image , shown as a still \( and also used on the video case \) , but with no development leading up to or away from it If the director had had an eye , he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie that is , a movie 
I had read a few positive reviews of this film , and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was Positioned as some cross between an AIDS related story and some kind of Ghost Blithe Spirit tale , this film ca n't always make it 's mind up what it wants to be br br Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship Simon is able to have anonymous \( though safe \) sex on the side when he wants Mark is HIV and he and Simon do n't seem to have a sex life anymore When Mark dies , Simon who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor Not that his behavior before Mark 's death was much different But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts , while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings br br Unfortunately , Simon is such a selfish SOB , it 's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic , it 's too late to care Mark , on the other hand , follows in Demi Moore 's footsteps from Ghost , by crying profusely throughout the movie br br There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor , a la the TV show Bewitched But that does n't last long Once Simon 's emotional health is at stake , the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish , with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings The finale , with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened , grief stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying , chiefly because it is n't intentionally funny 
Having read during many years about how great this film was , how it established Ruiz among the french critics \( specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd \) , when I finally watched it about a year ago , I found it pretty disappointing \( but then , I guess my expectations were sky high \) Shot in saturated black and white , this deliberately cerebral film \( made for TV , and mercifully , only an hour long \) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings \( which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants \) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime \( The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument \) Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie , but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film 
I awake suddenly , aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover , and realize it 's a warm Saturday afternoon Why was I sleeping \? Did I hit my head \? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma 's muscle relaxers \? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy \? br br No , I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing , and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out br br It 's that head shaking , mouth agape , shoulder shrugging bad But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me , and when he she woke up , a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep , no one will now how awful it is and he she can keep the 425 , 000 annual salary br br You 've been warned 
Leslie Sands' stilted play Deadlock becomes a poor choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill , just after their joint success in All About Eve After killing her spouse , a scheming woman is visited by her husband 's best friend , who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house Irving Rapper , one of Bette 's best directors from her peak years , is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material , in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale \( where she thankfully pulls out all the stops \) Production and supporting cast strictly second rate only for Bette Davis completists 1 2 from 
This movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd , grinding gears all the way to the sappy , b movie finish line The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie That is worth seeing The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast , you may miss it Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad to mediocre confusion There is no real conflict , and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character , Al I wonder if he 's got a job for me in Cincinnati \? 
The movie appeals to public due to charisma of Ben Stiller and notoriety of J Aniston It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title , but there 's nothing successful in this movie br br Polly is very well played by Aniston , no doubt This is the kind of character which suits her perfectly br br Bem Stiller is the same troublesome guy like in Meet the parents , but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above br br The script is very poor with nothing special at all With this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script br br 4 out of 10 
Even by 1942 standards of movie making the setup which HER CARDBOARD LOVER presents was dated to the extreme The machinations of one half of a pair \( of husband wife , ex husband ex wife \) to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another , divorce , or an eventual separation by means of jealousy , humiliation , or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as HIS GIRL Friday and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY Both of these movies features women with a strong , indomitable screen presence and who played independent , proto feminist characters In both movies , both women were estranged divorced from their \( witty \) first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite , and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon to be husbands and re igniting their passion for each other br br The plot in HER CARDBOARD LOVER switches the gender here , it 's Norma Shearer in the Cary Grant role out , this time , to ward off an ex boyfriend \( George Sanders \) by means of hiring Robert Taylor to pose as her gigolo The problem is , Shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid to late twenties Sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fianc e , on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here , would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene Not here And Robert Taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel Cary Grant half the time , not in speech inflections but in overall essence br br But the worst part of it is Shearer herself For an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence , playing Consuelo Craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over acting , over emoting , and over gesturing which , while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier , makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge It only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives Irving Thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of \( most of her \) roles why she passed on roles such as Charlotte Vale and Mrs Miniver on mega hits NOW VOYAGER and MRS MINIVER is a mystery , but then again , most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting , that she 'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it 's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and ca n't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible Such could be the case here She seems lost , she seems tired , she seems ill at ease , going through autopilot instead of living the part After this film she would make no more , but would be responsible of discovering Janet Leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s 
What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe That does n't rule it out however get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter Great wasted night stuff Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself often with respectable jobs \( estate agent \? \? \? \) But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality \( Grange Hill \) or soon to go on to poor quality drama \( Eastenders \) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable Are we really to believe that the ICF \( on whom of course the drama is based \) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes \? br br The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey A true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick go for it 
I'm a fan of Matthew Modine , but this film which I stumbled upon on cable is absolutely witless I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same , so there was no one around to check her worst instincts There are no surprises , no original lines , and no original characters The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character What a waste of all this acting talent Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days , I have to wonder how this got made in the first place And if you 're wondering why I watched it at all , it came on after a film that I like on cable and I left it on while I worked at the computer It 's not a very demanding picture ! 
I almost saw this at an actual movie theatre \( an art house theatre , no less ! \) but could n't make it there in the one whole week it played , but yesterday I finally saw it on cable and well I was n't disappointed , that 's for sure ! Madonna has done it again YET ANOTHER BOMB ! When will this woman learn \? When will the studios learn \? \( Or perhaps they already have , since this film was largely dumped , with little fanfare and deadly word of mouth \) One would hope that being directed by her talented husband , who 's created some interesting and or terribly entertaining work , would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in Desperately Seeking Susan alas , it just is n't meant to be , for here she is , at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness , the smugness permeating every frame she 's in , made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux British accent , an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman , and LOOK at her films of , say , the past decade like a latter day Bette Davis , there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body , which here , despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film \( perhaps its only saving grace \) , are done no favors To her credit , the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world 's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess No one involved escapes unharmed Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be on screen , though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she 's actually in something good , which had me thinking all the while , Denial ai n't just a river in Egypt ! Adriano Giannini , son of Giancarlo Giannini , star of the Italian original , Swept Away , is , like his father before him , immensely attractive , and is n't altogether bad \( despite winning a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor \) , but , like almost everything else about this production , it all comes back to Madonna , on whose shoulders rest the blame Why her \? Why not her husband , director Guy Ritchie \? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake \? What actress would n't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her , with only a relative nobody sharing the screen \? Oh sure , Ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone ANYONE ! should have , and could have , taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings \( for her performance is so wooden it 's a surprise the rest of the cast did n't get splinters \) , or at least display a semblance of warmth but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole Above and beyond anything else , this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it A film like this , an Odd Couple ish , war of the classes , should be light and fun , with leads who can bounce off one another with witty , even romantic , dialogue , for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded , really be \? Honestly , I do n't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy \( I defy you to laugh even once \) or romance \( Madonna 's ice princess routine precludes ANY chemistry \) It 's not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy A real shame 
I went into this film with expectations , from the hype , that it would be insightful and uplifting Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band Wilco br br Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process , a dishonorable and no doubt one sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer songwriter , a gut wrenching confession by the fallen member 's friend for like 18 years saying the friendship had run its course , and this whiny , uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them , only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels \( oh , the tension not ! \) They tried their best to make it look like it was a strain , but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did n't exist This does n't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline , insight or even a decent job at cinematography The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch br br From the film , this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they do n't have and think they 're some kind of guardians for the art of music , which they most definitely are not And I thought the music sucked , and I could n't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer br br I give it a 2 10 
The Eternal Jew \( Der Ewige Jude \) does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says , it simply says , without opposition , what it wants us to believe \( one will concede that American newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience , often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage \) Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was preaching to the converted , not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already , in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed The weakest link in the film 's logic shows in its rat analogy , wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats , and then adds something to the effect of Well , Jewish people are like that too Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad The film appears to contradict itself a few times , for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as light skinned Europeans thereby the text admits that so called Hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roach infested filth , despite the supposed treasure they 've hoarded , and then flip flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto Incidentally , who would n't \? The use of scenes from a well known American film , House of Rothschild , shows an equally blurry deployment of logic First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews \( the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews , shown as a means of avoiding taxation , although the Rothschild character 's spin is that Jews are taxed excessively \) finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings , but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching For all of Eternal Jew 's imperfections , I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is , just shy of a 5 to date I 'd say the reason is that EJ 's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose , offering us , unintentionally , a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence Needless to say the film 's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad , or simply evil , filmmaking as a propagandist 's tool About this time I should expect director Hippler to flip flop once again , springing forward to say That 's what I meant to do all along ! The scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome , and show same as decidedly inhumane , contrary to the intent of Kosher law to prevent animal suffering I would like for someone who has seen the film , and has some knowledge of these procedures , to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate

Anyway , we did n't actually expect it to be good we actually went in just to laugh at it Cool with me I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out , it did not matter br br After 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into Borat , a movie I would have gladly seen again over this The movie was not scary , and not stupid so it would be funny it was just boring It was n't terrible like Baby Genuises terrible , it was terrible like not entertaining at all Avoid br br Now I am no expert , but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a PG 13 horror that is boring and not scary , or you can have an R gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people br br You want a PG 13 horror that sucks but is funny \?

Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself Seriously , even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is , although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen ! Never bothered to post a comment on here before , but this piece of crap really warrants it br br Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical Brother of the lead character \( either Ben or Arthur , I forget which is which , and frankly it 's never very clear \) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians , but apparently mass murder is n't Then there 's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple 's ex wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint This leads to nothing , but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film I do n't make sense \? You do n't make sense ! That 's who makes sense ! Brilliant br br Then there 's the acting , which is just atrocious It must be seen to be believed My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman , who is clearly reading her lines off of something , yet still managing to mess them up Enough said The gay couple could n't be less convincing There 's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy , and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts Only fatter And less talented br br The film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still , and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on Yep br br But anyways , we all know how terrible this thing is , so I 'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides br br When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape Hilarious br br Mildread !

The tub of lard main character director producer gets naked It 's foul br br Basically , Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad , but unintentionally the most comical thing you 'll see for a long time Literally , nothing is good about this excuse for a film , the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times 
Hard to describe this one if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day , you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot , though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well \( what is he doing still making these movies anyway \? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie \? \) It was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length , and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E Brown comedy \( or , Abbott and Costello if that 's your thing \) basically just bad puns Still , I found this movie fascinating to watch , and for more than 2 reasons Good job , but still a fundamentally flimsy production 
I read the book and the book was fascinating br br This movie , it 's direction , the screenplay , and the acting were totally insufferable I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel , a novel that has all the action , simplicity , and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story br br I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know br br Simply , one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth br br The cinematography was indeed the only highlight But , how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as Peru br br To prospective viewers , do not waste your time or energy on this flop 
Mark Pirro 's Deathrow Gameshow of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts , but occasionally very funny nevertheless This movie could certainly have been a lot better , the acting is terrible , and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times , but the concept is funny , and it has some hilarious moments br br In the near future \( the year 1991 \) , game shows have changed Chuck Todean \( John Mc Cafferty \) hosts a game show called Live Or Die , in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives , and for money Candidates who fail , get executed on the air using many different methods , such as guillotines , electric chairs , and other , more bizarre devices of execution , followed by applause from the cheering studio audience The show is , of course , more than controversial , and Chuck has made lots of enemies br br Deathrow Gameshow is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects , and the acting is terrible , but it is without doubt fun in many parts , especially if you 're a fan of dark humor You have n't missed anything if you have n't seen it , but it is definitely funny and a good time waster 4 10
Ironically , although he can do the splits , Thomas is a complete stiff as an actor br br This film is seared into my memory as one of the most side splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies I have ever seen As such , I'm actually rather fond of it br br Still , the only reason this gets more than one star is that Thomas is great shape , and it 's fun to see his tiny , muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the East European country side \( including the infamous pommel horse shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers \) But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote , and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits br br Thomas at least had the excuse that he was n't really an actor Everyone else in the film actors , director , editor , camera guys , etc is at least as bad , or even worse , and most of them are professionals So Kurt does n't come off quite as badly as you might think br br I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran If anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again , I 'll bet that Thomas kicks the guy in the face 
While watching this movie , I came up with a script for a movie , called The Making of 10 Items or Less br br Producer I 've got good news and bad news The good news is , we can get Morgan Freeman ! br br Writer That 's great ! But what 's the bad news \? br br Producer We can only afford to hire him for one day I guess we 'll have to get someone else br br Writer So we hire him for one day A movie is an hour and a half long A work day is eight hours long I fail to see a problem br br Producer But he 'll have to spend time getting into character br br Writer So we have him play a character who is essentially himself br br Producer But he 'll still need to understand his motivation and all that You 're not saying we have him play a big name actor that 's doing a low budget movie , are you \? br br Writer Why not \? br br Producer That 's ridiculous ! But fine , at least we 'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie And I guess we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too br br Writer Of course br br Producer This script is a load of crap We 'd better make money on this Just in case , have Morgan Freeman 's character plug Wal Mart or Target or one of those stores , so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs br br Writer Sure thing ! br br Producer Wait a second what 's this about a tiny bodega with a ten items or less express lane \? br br Writer Oh , I guess that is pretty weird But we ca n't change the title now ! br br I doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality , but then neither did 10 Items or Less This is a case of good acting , but bad writing , and I hate to see it happen When watching an independent movie , you expect it to try to convey some sort of message I think they might have been trying for the tired old do n't let anything hold you back message that has been done to death in much better films In any case , with 10 Items or Less , the only message I got was Look ! Look at Morgan Freeman ! 
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more , even from a score of 5 8 IMDb , the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal , the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting Do n't waist your time this movie snt entertaining , if you wanna cry it might suffice though , even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy br br I give this 2 10 it really was awful , if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it , its all the good things this movie is n't 
There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring Just a notch above lowbrow \( thanks to Freeman and Spacey , who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films \) , the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as Justin Timberlake 's acting I hate to knock the guy , but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte , the better br br The movie is n't all bad just mostly I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man He deserves it And , unlike his fellow musician and co star , he can act Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well \( you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery \) , and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars \( out of ten he 's not THAT good \) br br When all is said and done , the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters All in all , t 's just plain boring That being said , rent this when you are suffering from insomnia 
Firstly , this is a very dated film , non focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution Honestly , when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual \( which in itself is quite nonsensical , since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual \) it reduces me to despair as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality it is simply ridiculous Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities , but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree But no doubt this non educational message ties in with Godard 's use of rock music hence The Rolling Stones br br The song 'Sympathy for the Devil' , whose creation we witness , and from which the film takes its name , is in fact nothing special The chord sequence , which is not especially original , was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelin 's 'Thankyou' \( Led Zeppelin II \) Apart form that , 'Sir' Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner \( rather like Bob Dylan \) notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse br br Besides the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film , do n't seem to know what they are fighting for , the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today \( indeed , a message that would belie the behaviour of The Rolling Stones around the time the film was made \) br br No wonder , the DVD came free with The Sunday Times ! For a truly profound historical exposition of left wing sympathy , listen to Luigi Nono 's masterpiece , 'Al Gran Sole carico 'd'amore' 
Usually I'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically Corey Haim 's performance was abysmal as usual , Nicole Eggert was not much better This has no redeeming qualities , even if you are a number 1 fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away ! 
Masters of Horror The Screwfly Solution starts as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population , when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of God Scientist Alan \( Jasn Priestley \) is brought in by the Government knows more than most senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife Anne \( Kerry Norton \) to take their teenage daughter Amy \( Brenna O'Brien \) try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them br br This Canadian American co production was episode 7 from season 2 of the Masters of Horrror TV series , directed by Joe Dante I thought The Screwfly Solution was pretty bad I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks , it takes itself far too seriously I do n't really understand why it 's part of the Masters of Horror series , the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself themes ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it 's gets the chance during it 's short 60 odd minute running time which I felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up I was n't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either , if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman 's neck on the plane \? Was he sexually aroused , I think not Why does every bloke then think he 's killing in the name of God \? I just ca n't see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible starting to believe in God , I just found the notion ridiculous the show also states clearly that there 's nothing religious about what 's going on so what 's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see \? Then there 's the fact people get turned on by different things , what about gays for instance \? Will they kill guys instead of women \? I know there 's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it 's conveniently brushed to one side then there 's the thing which annoyed me the most The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened , it just felt so stupid , the plotting is rubbish to round things off there 's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The X Files \( 1993 2002 \) with a bright neon alien br br Director Dante on this showing definitely does n't qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I'm concerned , the story is badly paced , it 's just so stupid considering it 's played deadly straight instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it 's deadly virus on the loose situation the subsequent mother daughter on the run because of it , there 's very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror even less gore There 's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle , a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about br br Technically like the other episodes it 's really good it does n't have the look of a cheap TV series , the special effects are great as usual it 's well made The acting is alright but no one really stood out br br The Screwfly Solution is easily the worst Masters of Horror episode I 've seen but bear in mind I have n't seen all of them yet As a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me as a show made by a so called Master of Horror it disappoints me even more 
Let 's be honest shall we \? Al Gore no more TRULY cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus It 's a hook ! Make no mistake , Al Gore is a POLITICIAN ! Three years ago he was busted ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid , a Yugo , or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN \( go google it if you like \) ! Or how about the fact that Mr Gore his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel guzzling jets to attend the premiers of An Inconvenient Truth So much for conservation huh , Al \? Anyway , it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at An Inconvenient Truth discover the main fundamental flaw While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed global Warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it For example I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot they can point out an automobile which is not running right BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY \? Generally not ! A second flaw , just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago \( the toilet was n't even invented yet \) \? What did they have , a June bug in a match box \? Hell , even 50 60 years ago \? Therefore , how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best \? Or that man is THE sole cause of it \? The answer is we do n't Science is NEVER a consensus Thirty years ago , Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a New Ice Age The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions , Solar Activity El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed Global Warming Finally , what Al Gore fails to adequately address is even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al implement everything he recommends , how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we ca n't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism \? Answer It 's wishful thinking , Mr Gore you being a former VP of the USA know it ! If the folks who produced An Inconvenient Truth were really honest , they would have titled their film Al Gore Wants Attention But what I 'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this why were two of the planet 's biggest polluters \( AKA China India \) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords \? Anyway , I hear the producers of A I T are working on their next film entitled Gnomes , Fairies Elves Our Endangered Friends 
Dr Hackenstein begins at the turn of last century , '1909 The dawn of modern medical science' to be exact Dr Eliot Hackenstein \( David Muir \) is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments , Dr Hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life It 's now 'Three years later' Dean Slesinger \( Micheal Ensign \) is round the Doc 's house for dinner As Dean Slesinger Dr Hackenstein eat they talk about Hackenstien 's experiments which Dean Slesinger has always been opposed to , Dr Hackenstein shows Dean Slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife Sheila \( Sylvia Lee Baker \) who died in an unfortunate 'accident' can telepathically talk to him \( Christy Botkin provides Sheila 's voice apparently \) Dr Hackenstein also show 's Dean Slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage explains that with the process he has developed he will bring Sheila back to life The Dean has some sort of seizure apparently dies Meanwhile sisters Wendy \( Bambi Darro as Dyanne DiRossario \) Leslie Trilling \( Catherine Davis Cox \) plus their Brother Alex \( John Alexis \) their cousin Melanie Victor \( Stacey Travis \) are driving along near Hackenstein 's house when they crash , they seek shelter assistance arrive upon Hackenstein 's doorstep Dr Hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night Later on Dr Hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers , Xavier \( Logan Ramsey \) Ruby Rhodes \( Ann Ramsey \) who deliver a male body when Hackenstein actually needs female parts for Sheila Dr Hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available starts to 'borrow' the bits 'n' pieces he needs to complete Sheila br br Written directed by Richard Clark I was pleasantly surprised by Dr Hackenstein , I 'll state right now that it ai n't brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was I actually quite liked it It moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it 's middle as things settle down The script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when Dr Hackenstein is trying to restrain Melanie she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper Yolanda Simpson \( Catherine Cahn \) by kicking out Hackenstein keeping Melanie behind Yolanda 's back who is seemingly oblivious to what 's happening , with a touch of gore but I 'd say Dr Hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception feel throughout There are some tacky puns sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh , Dr Hackenstein to Wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example I also thought the scene when Mrs Trilling \( Phyllis Diller \) reports her missing daughter 's to the bemused detective Olin \( William Schreiner \) was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle 's talking about why he is n't looking for them even though he has only just been told , why the cell does n't have a prisoner in it that if he did n't find the cousin not to worry about it None of it 's flat laugh out loud but I must admit I found myself smiling on occasion found the film as whole to be quietly amusing There is n't a lot of on screen gore , a few severed limbs , Sheila 's decapitated head , some medical stitching those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way I liked the characters in Dr Hackenstein too , which was surprise in itself The acting is n't brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it , lots of exaggerated facial movements some serious overacting means it 's never dull , oh the three birds in Dr Hackenstein are fit if you know what I mean Technically the film is OK as well , once again it ai n't going to win any Oscars but I have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting It does n't always work , the clothes are at odds with each other at times , the girls look like their from Victorian England while the guys look like their from a western The house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room stick a few candles in there ! It comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really is n't a bad looking film at all considering Could have done without the comedy music though Overall I ended up enjoying Dr Hackenstein much more than I thought I would , although that in itself is n't a recommendation It 's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made it certainly is not the worst either A watchable enough piece of harmless fun 
Admirably odd , though mean spirited comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome Robert Altman directed quasi comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight Some of the cinematography is evocative , Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide , and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Cort 's vision of a mother bird \( imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her ! \) In the lead , Bud Cort is once again , after Harold Maude a true original not off putting like , say , Michael J Pollard , Cort manages to be geeky , wacky and inoffensive , a tough act to pull off Unfortunately , this is one of Altman 's misfires He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else , but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward from 
You know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when br br 1 It was made it the 50 's 2 It 's in black and white 3 It has no name actors ! 4 Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects ! br br Well not to be outdone this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder br br Okay shhhhh but I am gonna discuss special effects here or lack of them br br Did you catch the underwater scenes \? It looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium note the cape flapping in the breeze br br And the repeated re use of Stock Footage , \( exterior house shots , the bridges scenes great enhanced the K R A F Tiness of this film not since PLAN 9 have I seen such creative usage of stock footage br br And hey where there was a lack of special effects not to worry screaming DOES take the place of special effects in this movie as well Yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick br br Grab the popcorn set your brain on stun \( several fermented beverages DEFINITELY helps \) , sit back , and wonder why the heck did they put this on film again \? br br Wayno br br 
Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems , nonetheless , to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co produced the film \? He 's a hero whom it 's very difficult to empathize with , so the movie is in trouble right from the start However , it 's troubles do n't end there It has the production values of a TV movie \( check out that head made of clay or something , near the end \) , and the ending cheats in a way that I ca n't reveal , in case anyone wants to see the movie \( highly unlikely \) Let 's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows \( 1 2 \) 
A good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable Regardless of the favorable comments here , this film is awful Badly directed Badly edited Badly acted Badly written You need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad br br The muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns Ustinov conning his way into an American insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility \( he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets , and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity \) br br As a side plot , Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith , who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere , while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil , which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since \( Nuns on the Run \? A Fish Called Wanda \? \) br br The surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before By the end I was thinking I must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this Even a cameo by Cesar Romero did n't help it One of the most unfunny , poorly paced 'comedies' I 've ever seen , and certainly the worst caper Do n't waste your time If you love this you need to see better films 
I saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was I usually enjoy bad movies , but this one was so revolting that it was n't even entertaining Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie , the hideous special effects \( when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate \) , and the disgusting acting The acting , in fact , is what I feel steals the show I did n't recognize any of the actors in the movie , and I hope that I never have to see any of them again Overall , I recommend renting this movie \( if you can find it I ca n't imagine a video store carrying this garbage \) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash 
Was this movie stupid \? Yup Did this movie depth \? Nope Character development \? Nope Plot twists \? Nope This was simply a movie about a highly fictionalized Springer show It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly 's mom Jaime is well GORGEOUS ! This flick was n't so much made to be a breakthrough movie , rather , it was intended to life in a trailer park \( I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie \) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all the girls get pregnant by different guys , and all the guys drive rusted out '66 Ford pickups \( exaggeration , of course , but that 's the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park \) Some people over analyze movies \( case in point Star Trek freaks \) I watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene \( read the Goofs bit about Connie 's shirt Could it have been better \? Sure But it was funny as hell 
It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels The script , the acting , the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling The costumes , sets and pseudo medieval language are also utterly awful In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film , once I had accepted that it was n't going to be any good It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor , when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise \( albeit not very believable ! \) , but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights , that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films Let 's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better ! Oh , and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He Man It does ! 
First one was much better , I had enjoyed it a lot This one has not even produced a smile The idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall , but in reference to the characters not the film maker 
Despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch The murder mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving Although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed It 's obviously a pre code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there 's even a song singing the praises of marijuana ! The performances are all one note although it 's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical but when Victor McLaglen , as the police Lieutenent , lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues , you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast forward to the next number Pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though ! 
I am a big 1930 's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me So I gave this a shot , after all it 's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian I have watched much less of Lloyd 's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I did n't finish it I can understand why his sound career was so limited , he did n't get very good material to work with After you 've seen Chaplin , Abbott and Costello , The Three Stooges , Martin and Lewis , The Marx Brothers , and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs \( or violence in general \) , this one is very forgettable I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film \( at least it seemed that way \) is before he gets in a ring I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time , 4 out of 10 Do n't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again , very flat For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend Kelly The Second made a few years earlier , another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel 
This movie features an o k score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr Hackenstein The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist , horror comedy , or low budget movies Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either This movie is simply here Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well If you are curious as I was and can actually find this , you will realize the truth of the one line summary 
This movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie 's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all However , I did not care for his mission to settle down , because I did n't care for his character I do n't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him He had absolutely no class , or charisma He should 've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing , but to no avail Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy Not to mention , the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous Does this man have any shame what so ever \? Had he tidied up , and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character , but alas , his character was bland and boring br br Gina Gershon 's character was unnecessarily British She could 've just as easily been an uptight out of towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie br br The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog Now those two had chemistry ! Academy nominations for both STAT ! Plot holes , lack of character development , horrible acting , unnecessary drama , clich moments What a mess of a movie 
Now , I have n't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here , so I'm not going to go down that path here br br But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply are not horror films , with perhaps a couple of exceptions This was not one of them It started well enough , and for once I'm not going to complain about the acting , although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills , as they were necessary to make the story here move forward br br But there was one consistent point that I could n't help but get annoyed with And that came pretty close to the end of the movie , and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity The moments I refer to are thus There is a tiny zombie running around the house You suspect it is under the bed Do you br br \( a \) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up , exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you , or br br \( b \) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety , or at least see the mini terror coming at you , giving you a little reaction time br br I know , let 's go with \( a \) I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today Bleh br br Fun enough film though Just not very scary 
movie goers avoid watching this movie if you are faint hearted , you might want to commit suicide if you are a short tempered , you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie br br Though he does not have any talent in acting , he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw pullers , auto rickshaw drivers , rowdies , thugs and immature and ignorant literates br br he proves you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully br br He is the highest paid actor in India That shows the taste of movie going public in India 90 of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies 
As I work at a video store , I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I 've ever seen , and warn my friends and co workers of it Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie , my friend dared me to watch B T K Killer , even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever , then he 'd watch it I lost I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school , and those were hardly great feats of a young genius This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value \( it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder , although it is surprisingly clear \) , but also in acting \( wooden , hollow , and pathetic do n't scratch the surface \) , as well as just generally bad movie feeling I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash , suddenly , I was reminded of some bad high school plays \( I know that I reference high school too often here , but this film did seem very juvenile \) both in terms of the set , which seemed far too fake , but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script , not entirely sure what was actually going on My review does n't do this film justice , because I ca n't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was It 's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie 
Saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly Also saying that the current available print is dark , dreary , scratchy , abysmally edited , painfully dubbed , seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct This film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full , uncut , original negative and seeing how it 's reasonably atmospheric \( and won the director an award at the Catalonia Film Festival \) , it might actually be worth the trouble Then again , maybe not It 's just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is It starts fairly interesting , if you can discount the completely senseless pre credits opening sequence , which involves a deranged cat killing , snake loving little girl named Gerda The girls mom , Carla \( M nica Randall , who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit \) , splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat Seemingly about as crazy as young Gerda , she goes to visit her estranged photographer \( ex \? \) boyfriend Mario \( John Cihangir Caffari \) He 's on vacation from work , but so desperate to get away from Carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment any assignment She scowls You 'll be sorry ! as he heads out the door Well , Mario is assigned to photograph Witches Mountain \( somewhere in the Pyrenees , I believe \) Before he gets to his destination , he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named Delia \( Patty Shepard \) and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top Only slightly peeved , she claims to be a single writer , the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together When they stop by her place so she can pack her bags , Mario suddenly hears loud , sinister music Delia claims he 's just hearing things br br So the two begin their trip up the mountain , taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night There they encounter a weird , partially deaf , crazy eyed innkeeper \( Victor Israel \) and Delia claims someone was spying on here through her window The next day , under some trance , she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by Mario , who hops out of his jeep and runs after her While he 's finding out what 's up , someone steals their wheels and they 're forced to walk a piece , eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small , ancient , seeming abandoned village almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there Well as we will see , that 's exactly what has happened In the village they encounter a friendly old woman named Zanta \( Ana Farra \) who claims she 's the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home Mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people Slightly creeped out , he and Delia begin to leave and get stuck in treacherous fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night The rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls , black cats transforming into sexy women , Satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff And yeah , coincidentally Carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches , too It all takes place in semi darkness and to be quite honest , I did n't know what the hell was going on most of the time The inconclusive open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess br br Honestly , there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good The first is actress Shepard , who has that great Barbara Steele kind of dark , mysterious beauty There 's also an excellent music score \( credited to Fernando Garcia Morcillo \) and chanting songs , which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is The location work is fairly decent , but as I said , the print is ugly as can be and it does n't make a lick of sense , so proceed with caution on this one 
A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house , or was it from a lover 's apartment \? Rogers actually has two identities at the film 's outset , that of Miss Terry , the dead victim 's secretary , along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand \( Talbot \) instead of her paper 's rewrite desk , she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he 's been out scooped br br Here 's a puzzle it 's revealed during Police Inspector Russell 's \( Purnell Pratt \) investigation of Harker 's death that Terry Morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks Why exactly was that \? After the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story , but before \? Clues are dropped regarding Harker 's association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building , but again , that association is n't relevant until it 's all linked up to janitor Peterson \( Harvey Clark \) And who 's making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS , with the words You will hear it cut and pasted beneath \? Apparently , the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house 's radiator system , which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims , such as Mrs Coby in the apartment below Harker But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs Coby 's death , he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation br br It 's these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me The revelation of janitor Peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of Miss Morgan in the building 's incinerator furnace ! However , and score another point against continuity , we see Miss Morgan in a huge basement room as Peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway , but how \? And still pretty as a picture And who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant Wilfred \( Arthur Hoyt \) , who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room br br Sorry , but for all those reviewers who found A Shriek in the Night to be a satisfying whodunit , I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable The Usual Suspects by comparison If you need a reason to see the film , it would be Ginger Rogers , but be advised , she does n't dance 
One missed call , another Asian horror based on the cell phone I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called Pon One Missed Call was just as boring as that one Maybe phones just are n't scary or something , but this move was dull and drab No tension or thrills for me , and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts , and felt too long Did n't keep my attention It seems phones are hard to make frightening , it 's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie And it is ridiculous to compare this with The Ring , it seems every Asian horror movie is compared to it and so far I have n't seen any that measure up in the least To horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device 
Yes , he is ! No , not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies Pintilie IS THE naked emperor so to speak br br It 's big time for someone to state the truth This impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man 's body His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever It is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies And if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard on ! Did you know that , on the set of Niki Ardelean , he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss , by telling her Oh , Coca , how I wanna f you ! \? She is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction ! And , as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences , so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art ! Will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all \? 
If you seen Rodney Dangerfield 's previous movies and performances , you 'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck Written like a sitcom , this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout , from the self help doctor played by the aways sexy as chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat , and therefore funny' John Linette The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough , and if this had been done as a pilot for an action adventure series , it might have worked Instead , it comes off like a male fantasy that 's trying hard not to be politically incorrect 
I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist Where the Exorcist was subtle and creepy , Stigmata was blunt , clumsy , and way too formulaic br br This is one of the most visually beautiful films I 've seen in a while , but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable br br My interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to The Exorcist , and my visit to the official web site increased that interest The web site had many tales of actual stigmata throughout history However , scene by scene , the movie is so obsessed by its quest for genuineness that it becomes comical at first , then outright hard to watch toward the end I began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would be heroine cuts hair and , evidently , flirts with priests br br The plot A woman without faith in God begins receiving the wounds of Christ \( the Stigmata \) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal A priest is sent straight from the Vatican to investigate the case Is Frankie possessed by Satan , or a vessel for Jesus Christ \? br br The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends 
I liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one pretty much knows what 's going to happen within the first 20 30 minutes \( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody \) br br There is no real twist \( which is fine \) , but the final reveal does n't make a great deal of sense either \( how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film , if she 's an evil id from beyond the mirror \? \) br br Admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde 's murder is also effectively creepy , but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script , piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80 90 minutes does not really cut it , in fact it gets quite dull 
I do n't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that , this movie stunk I did n't know whether to turn off the set , or file a lawsuit with O J 's attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health I have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet The whole story was stupid , the acting was uninspired , the 'drama' was emotionless I am thankful I did n't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience 
I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti Christian pseudo documentary got Now , I respect the guy 's opinion and faith , I myself am not , at this state , believer of the taught Christian doctrine However , anti Christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue br br This film has valid points , but they are very few and represented in a very biased context I'm not recommending against seeing it In fact , I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject , it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood It also misrepresents the Christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists , no moderation in between br br The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ without permission , sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti Christian historians and writers I actually found the headmaster to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry br br With this being said , there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity But the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive , highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased 
or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked , 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson , your film has arrived ! Film starlet Laura Crawford \( Ursula Buchfellner \) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of 6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway What they do n't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston \( Cliver \) being hired by a film producer to save the girl And what they really did n't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes br br Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS , this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value , thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes \( Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc 's interview \) Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn \( CONTAMINATION \) and Werner Pochath \( whose death is one of the most head scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown in close up trying to be him \) The film features tons of nudity and the gore \( Tempra paint variety \) is there The highlight for me was the world 's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves Sadly , ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing \( and , at times , agonizing \) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops br br For the most part , the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes Also , one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs \( they are an option , but only when you listen to the French track \) Franco gives a nice 16 minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani 
Im watching it now on pink \( Serbia TV station \) and I must say this is a crap Shallow , no acting , effects too sloppy I mean , who made this series \? br br This was a stupid attempt of the Studios to make some more money on the success of the film OK The film was great in 1994 when it came out But the series \? br br Some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters I mean , did they actually pay someone to write that , was that someones relative at the Studio \?

For the knowledgeable Beatles fan , the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws , inaccuracies , combined events , omitted events , wildly exaggerated events , omitted people , timeline errors , mis attribute quotes , incorrect clothing , out of place songs , and \( shame shame \) incorrect instruments and other boners I just cant think of right now The flaws come fast and furious so you 'll have to be on your toes br br I did n't give this a 1 primarily due the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors \( the band Rain \) give it their all \( the Lennon character is credible and does a good job \) Also , the song Cry for a Shadow is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING br br So , , , watch it for fun , but please do n't take it as historically accurate 
My first question after seeing this film was , Why is the title LIAM \? If the intent was to tell a story from the boy 's perspective , it was not carried out well Of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy 's scenes , but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view Having a main character unable to speak \( obviously suggesting the mute , powerless position of a child \) makes it difficult to give that character much depth br br Melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters , exaggerated emotions and language , simplistic morality , and conflict LIAM fits this definition to a T The viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone Catholic Church in the stern school marm and the well fed priest squeezing money from parishioners \( A stereotype which is becoming very tiresome \) What 's more the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners ! br br Much of the film was predictable Who did n't think that we 'd see Theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her No daughter of mine will scrub another woman 's toilet ! I'm a fan of British realism if it 's done well In my opinion , LIAM is not br br 
This movie was messed up A sequel to John Carpenter 's Vampires , this did n't add up right I'm not sure that I enjoyed this much It was a little strange Stick to the first Vampires , it 's a good movie Vampires Los Muetos was n't a good attempt of a sequel br br 4 10
Now look , I wo n't lie to you , but I only got this movie for 3 99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth , the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band Cradle Of Filth in it I expected of course violence and gore at its finest , as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as , amongst a plot line br br But dear god , I was oh so wrong This movie seriously bites , big time Being a low budget film \( haha , wait , make that ZERO BUDGET \) , this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects Nope , it 's all one camera , bad angles , and bad blood scenes br br Take for example when our star and violent fiend , Mr Filth , violently kills a mugger A grab at the throat , and blood spits out , but oh my , it looks like there 's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man 's shirt br br To you Cradle Of Filth fans You 'll hear two songs throughout the movie , but with the camera angles and shoddy filming , they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN br br My final comment Steer well away from it It 's blood , gore , breasts , and hey , even a shoddy story to go with it So if you like appalling violence , near no voices \( yes , there 's hardly any words in this movie \) , then by all means , buy it But if shoddy movies is n't your thing , then avoid it Do n't waste your money 
Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick Very embarrassing Nacho had made some commercials in TV , I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid \( the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection \) br br This little movie is like a Nacho 's commercial bad storyline , bad directing , and awful performances I ca n't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater Poor Oscar br br Nacho could made this movie because of his wife , the producer of this 7 35 , a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men 
My God , was this the Run , Lola , Run adaptation of Persuasion \? It was horrible Bad enough that the screenwriter \( and I use the term very loosely \) cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another , often completely out of context and to rush the story along but Anne Elliott running from location to location in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination ! Austen must be spinning in her grave No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion And the actress that played Mary \? Horrors Needless to say , if the rest of the Austen remakes are this bad , they will be turning off a new generation of watchers br br If you want to see an impeccable version of this \( otherwise \) wonderful novel , get the 1995 Roger Michell directed version starring Amanda Root \( whose expressions alone can speak volumes \) and Ciaran Hinds It is superb 
The viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one , or why , for that matter , anyone bothered to make it There is no plot just random scenes of ridiculous action Mia Sara 's shower scene appeals to the male libido , but that 's not much reason to make a movie 
I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out br br Having watched it I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of British comedy br br From beginning to end the film is predictable , tedious , dull , monotonous and cringe worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in dis belief Until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un romantic and un comedic a romantic comedy can be br br It 's not only a bad story , but a badly made film In one scene , you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S A 's when to wipe across I will post details of this in the 'Goofs' section br br On the up side , it did fill me with emotions \( disappointment , rage , embarrassment \) 
Yes I know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films It comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines , rolling their eyes , using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema , which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film In next chronological order they could see Titanic \( 1953 \) A Night to Remember \( 1958 \) Titanic \( 1997 \) , to see how the cinema 's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious SOS Titanic \( 1979 \) On my version which is a DVD , David McCallum gives the introduction It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi 's junior wireless operator in A Night to Remember \( still the best feature film please read my Tribute to Walter comments on IMDb under Howard Morley demon co uk \) and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled End of a Dream so he was well qualified to give the narration Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer , J Bruce Ismay , Managing director of White Star , Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart \( The old Rose in Titanic 1997 \) whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors 
It 's hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck ! I do think kids can enjoy it , but to me it 's the kind of kid film parents ca n't bear to sit through Predictable plot , boring Belushi , and possibly the worst kid actor of all time I will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid , but she was truly painful to watch I feel embarrassed for her now , having people know it was her When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search I 've always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful , sadly missed brother , and this crap shows why Zero stars 
I do agree with everything Calamine has said ! And I do n't always agree with people , but what Calamine has said is very true , it is time for the girls to move on to better roles I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people , actresses and in their career as well as their personal life So producers , please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit , move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets This movie that is being commented is not too bad , but as I have seen further on in their movies , their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds , maybe some that are like the sixth sense , the hour , chocolat , that sort of movie not saying to have just serious movies for them , humour ones too yes , but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute \( Note I am from Australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z \) 
I wondered why I did n't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did , when it first came out in 1986 , with all the hype Somehow I found Nic Cage 's character off putting Way off putting Then the plot did n't seem to make sense Then by the end of the credits , the question came to mind What point was this movie making \? What was it saying \? The answer , unfortunately , was not much , if anything I really do n't think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life , you 're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what , so keep your eye upon the doughnut , and not the hole Not a very profound statement , and I'm sorry , not profoundly made in this movie The writing simply is n't that good The direction is uneven , and is strangely overblown at times Kathleen Turner was the best , and in my opinion , only worthwhile thing in this movie , and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre , unexplained circumstances , with a script that had no apparent statement to make br br She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I did n't enjoy this movie more She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola 's direction every step of the way , doing it his own way \( not a good idea for a new actor \) , and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid His voice was annoying , abrasive and unnatural , and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy I understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is , setting up his own karma for future failure But he goes overboard , the way he does it is abrasive , not effective , and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man , we would have had a more enjoyable film Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person , and those scenes are more watchable than others But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety , I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L A to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected \( put on \) scenes br br The movie does n't aim for a statement , does n't make a point , is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression \( but without the voice \) , and is , ultimately , confusing and a waste of time Given all this , Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie I ca n't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this , unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes Believe me , you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes , and it will make just as much sense br br Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments , which proves that she 's strong enough to be honest , and to hell with other people 's comments You go , Turner ! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first rate actor or actress , but her candor is refreshing Cage 's acting can be good to annoying , and here it does n't work At least , in this film , now we know why 
This is the biggest piece of crap ever It looks like they spent more time , effort , and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someone 's homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats The picture is really clear , but that , along with the very unfortunate lighting , cinematography , if you can call it that , production , acting , if that is actually what they are doing , and script , if they had one , makes this movie look worse than an old porno At least the old porno has a point This just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really disturbing , pointless PSA about animals rights and feelings This is so not worth the money or the time It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims The people who made this movie should be glad he 's not still free , or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad 
Holy freaking God all freaking mighty This movie was so bad , I thought I was on drugs In a bad way The character acting is the poorest thing I 've seen in quite some time This movie was more akin to Lord of the G Strings , IMHO \( it 's a real movie \) Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen My favorite part was when they are in the carriage , and you can tell there 's no horse They 're fleeing from alien monsters , and going about the same speed as a swift jog Then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous CG horse And the CG in general seems to be sub par to 1992 's Beyond the Mind 's Eye I mean , Come on , really It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules , only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day Worst Movie Ever 
T Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s , but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times , styles and fashions He 's like stuck with the same old fashioned film making style br br Actors are not bad , not good either Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son , but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic Rekha is good , but then she 's always good , and here she 's nothing more than such She makes the best of what she is given , but she always does that In conclusion , nothing great at all Raveena is OK , which means ordinary , not bad , not good , nothing br br This film is melodramatic , occasionally stupid Maybe it 's a delayed film \? Well , even then it still would be below standard The script is terrible , the film is overdone , and the story goes nowhere It feels like a film made in the early 1990s , but the script makes it look even older , the style is like from the 1950s br br Do n't recommend , unless you 're a big fan one of the starring actors 
I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but , seeing it again 20 years later , it actually sucks Up The Academy might have been ahead of it 's time back in 1980 , but it has almost nothing to offer today ! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile No T A No great jokes except for the one liners we 've all heard a million times by now br br I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being Well , I was WAY off ! The soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits \( not the smash compilation others had mentioned \) and the frequent voice overs were terrible The only thing that was interesting , to me , was predicting what the character 's lines were before they said them Yep , I watched this movie that much back then ! br br The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten , sorry to say \( 
 br br The main question I pose concerning this film is , how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs ! merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway , here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball plot changes abound and the fun is lost br br SKIP IT 
I would n't say this totally sucked , but if it was n't for Netflix I would n't even have this in my house Steve Martin 's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat He 's just not funny He 's another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character could n't get pregnant The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts , but it seems to simple simmer along , not really entertaining or creating laughs 
I frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market , and sadly White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor I was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static induced headache increased I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton , I was totally unaffected by his demise Up until the credits I diligently awaited for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters' story , but such relief never came Sure , there were the occasional heart stopper moments , but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer br br While the acting was lame , Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton 's abodes Overall , White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows , contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves 
This movie was one of the worst I 've ever seen Pure drivel How anyone could develop a connection with the heroine , or have empathy for her , is beyond me I felt I was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder Just terrible br br In its most generous light , this can be seen as an attempt at producing and art film except I could not , for the life of me , find any art in it at all br br If this woman had lived in todays' world , she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti psychotic medications That , or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman Why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort 
I loved Adrianne Curry before this show I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won I also liked Chris Knight , he seems like a great guy But this show just made me SICK ! I'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show I do n't care that they were different ages , I know age ca n't stand between love But Adrianne , you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS It did n't surprise me at all that he had n't proposed And I do n't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they 're ready If it 's meant to be , then why not just ENJOY each other 's company and love each other , and let it come naturally \? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary , it 's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you , with or without a ring And Chris , shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway ! You 've been through two failed marriages , how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit \? I hope the relationship lasts , but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage 
Oh , brother The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it 's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film \( when they were n't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy \) But even as a longtime Stooges fan I 'd have to say that young Moe , Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr Healy 's taller boss janitor They 're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on and off again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing br br Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen \( here 's a good example of the level of humor I object ! On what grounds \? Coffee grounds ! \) His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante , but even the schnoz himself is a bore 
 Well Chuck Jones is dead , lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions , an American drawn anime knock off style , and give them superpowers but sir \? , do n't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this \? much less do n't dump all over their original creators dreams yes ! and those shows make us a bunch of cash , and we need more ! but wo n't every man women and child , who grew up with these time less characters , be annoyed \? hay you 're right ! set it in the future , make them all descendent 's of the original characters , and change all the names slightly but not too much though , we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics br br Well that 's the only reason I can think of why this even exists If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons , then it looks like an OK show But then there is already the teen titan 's , which is the same bloody thing All the characters are dressed like batman , they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains , they have superpowers , only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits br br This kind of thing falls into the it 's so ridiculous it 's good kind of category Think of the Super Mario brother 's movie , and Batman and Robin If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons , check this out If you are of the younger generation \( what this thing is actually intended for \) , and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness , then run with it and enjoy br br If you enjoy this cartoon I do n't have a problem with you , it 's the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon , shoved them on a display , dressed them up in err pirate costumes , and charged money If this show was n't using characters \( ones that did n't resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever \) that have already made the studios millions , then this would be fine But no ! For shame Warner brothers , for shame br br If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpson 's or Family Guy , I would love it As it is I just ca n't believe this was ever made I would bet anyone that 80 of the people who work on this show hate it But whatever it does n't really matter , in 10 years this show will have been forgotten , while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world ends br br Coming 2008 , Snoopy and the peanut gang are back , and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible ! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar \? Tune in and see 
What a horrible movie I cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re make Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this film \? Mehki Pfifer is great in E R and Ving Rhames probably did n't know what he was doing I feel terrible for them The music background i must say did not fit AT ALLLLL with the story and it 's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film I hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was , could ever distroy such a great classic film This film should not have been made in the first place An advice to everyone who has seen it , please tell me that i'm right because i could n't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it br br BOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 10 out of 10 
 SPOILERS This was an ugly movie , and I'm sorry that I watched it Like Jan Kounen 's Dobermann , it suffers mostly from poor editing or lack of it It is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention , he added all of the footage he had shot together There are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie One of them is SPOILER when Benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him That was cool but okay , we got it ! Move on please ! The camera wo n't stop spinning around this guy ! There 's maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity , but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM ! It may be because unlike in the earlier sword handling scenes , Shanao is n't masked but just because the director could n't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu does n't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme close ups of sword clashes ! And all from the same angle , may I add The director should learn from the American produced 1995 bullet train ninja movie The Hunted ! I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media , due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples END SPOILER I do n't understand I just do n't understand why people who do n't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this Maybe the worst was lost in the translation br br The ending of the movie on which marketing played a lot , is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore , and it is so detached from contemporary themes , that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques , who cares how the director wants to re interpret the story ! \? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences , and target their movies for foreign film festivals in order to gain faster international fame This works , although it does n't make sense , because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries what kind of movies people WATCH in those countries Certainly not Gojoe and the like 
Yet again one of the most misunderstood Goddesses of my country has been twisted by Westerners who cannot understand the esoteric symbolism of the Mother Goddess in her dark forms The Mother takes on the frightening form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner demons , and to terrify our egos And though blood sacrifice is given to Kali and Durga , the events depicted in this film are just absurd The Mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons , limitations , and ego when no other form will suffice It 's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your Karmas in the Smashan fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her , and she will bring you to reality and truth Reality and truth has a dark side as well as light , which serves a purpose The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well , she is Nature Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance You cannot have growth and life without death and destruction Kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe It 's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of India or it 's divinity can just take one of our beloved Goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low budget , talentless horror film How dare they take our beloved Mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off ! \? She is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion , greed , anger , and other inner demons It 's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self deluding ego , and serious inner demons to see Kali as so horrible and terrible When the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting , beautiful , and young , a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire Universe with it Kali Maa is an ancient Mother , not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment , let 's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie br br The audacity that Westerners have in using religions like my own , or the religions of the Caribbean Islands such as Santeria , and Vodou which are actually very positive , and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the Western mind cannot comprehend , is totally ridiculous It 's clear that there is no respect for what people live , breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks br br Kali Maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother , whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for And I am happy that my Mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces br br Many Praises to the REAL Kali Maa , who has shown MANY the path of God and realization 
SAKURA KILLERS \( 1 outta 5 stars \) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool if you had never ever seen a good ninja movie Cheesy '80s music cheesy dialogue cheesy acting and way beyond cheesy martial arts sequences The coolest scene is at the beginning with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and naw , I wo n't spoil it for you if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you 'll thank me The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something A bunch of dim bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something like that Strange , these guys do n't seem to fight any better after their training than before oh well , the movie does move along pretty briskly The fight scenes may not be great but they are plentiful and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles 
It 's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts , but I know that humor is VERY subjective I have seen all of their sound shorts \( by far the best of their stuff IMO \) and I found this one of their weaker efforts br br In the year this was made \( 1930 \) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly In addition , this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan I would say this was an experiment that really did not work As someone else said , it does not play to their strengths Too much dialog and plot br br The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about girl stuff br br If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out Blotto , or Brats From the same year br br They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts They made something like 108 films altogether Very few \( except for the ones made at FOX \) were outright failures but there are some County Hospital , Me And My Pal , The Live Ghost , The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones But other then those I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts Quite a record in my book br br If you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out , but I would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to Stan and Babe 
After a series of power outages on a remote island zoo , genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island Man , the sci fi channel has made some bad original movies , but I think this might possibly be their worst so far ! This badly written and directed Jurassic Park rip off offers all the usual clich s \( mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are expendable losses , characters walking down long dark hallways alone , brain dead teen characters who 's only function in the film is to die a horrible death , etc \) , and , unsurprisingly , no suspense whatsoever The special effects are atrocious the puppet heads in close ups of the title beasties are bad enough , looking like stiff plush dolls , but the CGI which makes the computer generated dinosaurs in Walking with Dinosaurs look life like by comparison are just downright awful There 's some gore , but most of it looks pretty unconvincing Oh , and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things I 've seen in years I could n't even laugh it was so bad ! br br Do n't waste your time , this one is just downright bad br br 2 10 br br Oh , and here 's some interesting trivia for you this film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci fi film Alien Hunter , which was far superior to this piece of crap 
I saw this movie when I was really little It is , by far , one of the strangest movies I have ever seen Now , normally , I like weird movies , but this was just a bit too much br br There 's not much of a plot to the movie If anything , it starts out like Toy Story , where toys come to life , and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend , Babette From there , craziness ensues There 's the Greedy , the Looneys , a sea monster named Gazooks , and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes , all of which just made the movie weirder Also , I ca n't help but feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny She definitely did n't help the movie br br Now , even though I did n't like this movie , there were a few cute parts I liked the camel 's song Even though it was a song about being lonely , it had a friendly feel to it Then , there was Sir Leonard While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts , Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest King Koo Koo was just a little dirtbag that made Dr Evil look like a serious villain Also , there was Raggedy Andy 's song , No Girl 's Toy It was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough But , honestly , even these things did n't make the movie any better \( But remember , this is just my perspective \) br br While I personally would n't recommend this movie , even I have to admit , it does have its charming moments See it if you 're interested , but only if you 're in the mood for something really out of the ordinary 
The writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity Did writer 's block set in so badly , OR had ideas dried up so much , that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van , and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind \( mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth \) We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint , as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting once would have sufficed we got the message ! This really is taking toilet humour to another level ! Had the script and acting been better then I could have easily forgotten that I was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video This was a fairly original storyline , with a clever \( the only \) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van thus making it feel much more real We never got to see inside any other locations , such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared , and this could have added much needed tension br br The script was dire Lines like 'I do n't feel too good I want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at , seem a little undercooked br br The acting was diabolical \( apart from the maniac \) Did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike ! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on br br The director seemed to have an easy job in this It seems that the only direction he must have given was 'Scream girls' br br AND AS FOR THE SCREAMING If you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready ! 
You do realize that you 've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years , right \? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an Island , but you 'd think that after watching unkempt , stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original \( and interesting \) br br And I'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable It 's just hard to suspend disbelief for Bushy Bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno 's with moxy br br What 's the appeal here \? I do n't care about these people or their meandering lives I just do n't get it But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy , unwashed people , I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE , and free of charge , you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters , eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade Dr Frankenstein styled cancer stick , all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of Aqua Velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise And the best part \? Much like Survivor , every week one member of the tribe Leaves the Island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear ! Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT ! 
I purchased this film on the cheap in a sale , having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that either way I ca n't lose , it if was rubbish then no loss , if it was any good then bargain br br Then I watched it br br I am normally a fan of Christopher Walken , but in this film he commanded very little screen presence , seeming not to do a whole lot , even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the action in the plot seems to affect him very little , and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic br br Normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters , however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused , and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it 's eventual conclusion br br At this point I wept br br I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing I have ever been subjected to , the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful , although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl The acting was poor all round , the script and story was weak , the action was even weaker , and the visuals were but bluntly not all that visual To summarise there are films which are good , films that are bad , films that are so bad they are good , films that are terrible br br And then on a whole new level is McBain 
After having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country , I but wanted to see it But what a disappointment ! To see a bunch of one dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend I sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland 
There 's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland , and Robot Wars does deliver Sure , the acting is lousy , the dialogue is sub par , and the characters are one dimensional , but it has giant robots ! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period They are certainly not as polished as today 's standards , but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures , so it has aged fairly well Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime , and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction 
What a great actor to have in such an awful story br br The film and its production , however , is quite good , even though set in London but with exteriors in Bristol No matter see one cathedral , you 've seen 'em all , sort of br br The story however is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything , should he so wish With just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis , the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy , a teenager and finally as a man so much so , in fact , that he exacts vengeance at will , literally Over time , he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot just by thinking about it ! br br The trouble with the narrative , however , is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi religious claptrap to produce a hodge podge theory about it all Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works and I'm afraid Richard Burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing His very best scene , however , is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp , witty and deadly dialog , delivered as only Burton could br br A good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better , though , beginning with Lino Ventura , whom I last saw in Garde A Vu \( 1981 \) , as Inspector Brunel Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner the much under rated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld Derek Jacobi as a publisher , Towney , and a few other well known character actors br br I liked the way the story was presented , as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar \( Richard Burton \) , the writer with the killer disposition Up till that point , it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick Still , it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer br br Then , they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes If you want a clue about what that is , think Samson and Delilah \( 1949 \) , from the illustrious Cecil B de Mille , and how Samson got the bad guys in the end And , the very last scene is just plain stupid Why \? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar 's rampaging could have been stopped , absolutely br br Shame , actually , because this could have been a lot better story and movie I guess Burton really needed the money br br If you 're Burton fan , then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above Otherwise , do n't bother 
I noticed Fire was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I could n't recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in '85 Twenty years later the film is still awful Besides the synthesizer , the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s , as is evident in the title song Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe 's character played saxophone , and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker , only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo All the characters were intensely unappealing , although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing , and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear , but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe 's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon 
Turn your backs away or you 're gonna get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK ! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you 're watching this It 's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart , with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max We get a name like Johnny every so often , and this Johnny has nowhere to go There is n't a specific reason to why our dead corpse crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night , so that renders the movie totally useless Without a feeling of sorrow , his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he 's dead Johnny takes a bite out of Eddie 's arm afterwards The viewer is asked a tough question Why does the movie have to be this cornball \? There is an answer Any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental Living is a coincidence Dead has nothing in common with the movie Show this one to your girlfriend and she 'll skip the senior prom , turning your life into a deserted ruin Blah ! ! ! 
The orange tone to everything was just yucky Oh yeah , the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange tinted with orange tinted people Meanwhile , to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body , she plays a full immersion video game \( which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay \) She apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company \? Lots of non speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly She uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and I can only suspect a Microsoft future release br br Meanwhile , I the viewer , ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life \? Oh yeah , playing games is fun , but what is the point when you 're almost starving \? While she is piddling her life away playing some lousy even more orange tinted lame full immersion video game her dog runs off \( probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and feeds it regularly \) or is stolen from the woman \( while she is ignoring her lousy orange tinted reality \) br br Meanwhile she obsesses over some game her game playing team lost the entire uninteresting movie Yawn So she wants to be the best of the best , go get them Ash Catchem \( got to bore us all \) Golly , this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty \( which she could barter for some manner to escape her crushing poverty \) br br So she reaches the Real level and it , at least , not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate mentally living in the Real level Finally the sucky boring bland orange tinted movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch , but has the potential to say something along the lines the main character is trapped in imaginary computer generated poverty and she is actually in the real world now Perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now \? Well , she kills the guy and he vanishes in a digital effect Wow ! Thanks idiotic director You suck , you suck so very much , director br br Here the director had an iota of a chance to redeem himself slightly by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist br br The director could have said , The REAL WORLD is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better , it wo n't be some cruddy orange tinted poverty land A clever way to make this suck tacular movie a agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride \( for the 1 of the viewers that have n't found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are movie masochists \) br br Nope , director The director had to screw this all up by tossing in some cruddy digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money , a waste of time , and a waste of viewer trust br br After that , it ends Good riddance I hope the director chokes on it I'm putting this HACK on my avoid at all costs list for any other films his name is attached to 
At least I was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since I was barely able to sit through it In all honesty , my guess is the cover to the DVD case cost more than the entire movie And saying that it is the same director as The Boogeyman , when a new version of that just came out nice touch guys , it was misleading enough to rope me in The only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut Usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it The film looks like it was shot by a D grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes sometimes , less is more buddy Through out I would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained All this makes a bad movie but when the ending does n't even come close to pulling it together , well , that makes it an exceptionally bad movie Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen , and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school , but hey maybe i'm a bit biased , I mean I did get to play an extra P S I do n't even think this deserves a star not even a half NONE FOR YOU ! ! 
How unfortunate , to have so many of my a list , and good b list actors agree to do this movie , but they did , and that is what sucked me into watching it I had never heard of this movie , but there was Cuba Gooding Jr right on the DVD cover , and James Woods in the background how bad can it be \? In a word Very ! This movie starts o k has some twists and turns , then just lays an egg The ending was so weak , it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending How ironic a for a movie titled The end game to have such a poor one These are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry I hope Cuba Gooding JR , and James Woods do n't make a habit of this

How viewers react to this new adaption of Shirley Jackson 's book , which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie \( true enough \) , will be based , I suspect , on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either , and who are big fans of Hollywood 's current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is , are going to love it br br Things I did not like about this adaption br br 1 It was NOT a true adaption of the book From the articles I had read , this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to And , that seemed reasonable , no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND ! \( And not even then \) But , there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at , in the movie Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING I did n't like that , either What the movie 's press release SHOULD have said is We got the basic , very basic , idea from Shirley Jackson 's book , we kept the same names of the house and several \( though not all \) of the leading character 's names , but then we decided to write our own story , and , what the heck , we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first , and decided to throw in a bit of them , too br br 2 They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts , to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad No , instead , this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia \( he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear like lab rats , who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy \) This doctor , who did not have the same name , by the way , was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day br br 3 In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad , this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and , this time around , Nel gets to unravel the mystery \( shades of THE CHANGELING \) The only problem was , the so called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience but , then there was no mystery in the first place \( not in the book \) , because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH It 's first victim died before ever setting eyes on it br br 4 The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house \( and was a true skeptic of it 's history \) and in this one he was just a winey voiced , bumbling nerd who could n't sleep \( insomnia remember \) and was a compulsive liar br br 5 I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word \( the scene with Nel 's sister 's family , and Mrs Dudley 's little opening speech \) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING It 's like it could n't make up its mind what it wanted to do br br 6 I missed Nel 's narrative through the whole movie The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person , through Nel 's eyes , and we always were privy to her thoughts That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine The original Nel was not a bad person , but she was a bitter person \( could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister \? \) and she liked to moan , and she lost her temper This one was almost too good to be true This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer 's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times br br 7 They changed the history of the house and it 's occupents too much There was no Abigail Crain \( the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions \) , there was no companion , and there was no nursery There was also no Grace \( wife of the original doctor \) and Hugh Crain 's wives died in totally different ways These changes , changed the story WAY too much I do n't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should BE SORRY \( if ya get my drift ! ! ! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with ! ! ! \) br br In conclusion , let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke \( appropriate substitution of the word house for movie ! \) This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground , and the ground sprinkled with salt ! My favorite movie of all time remains so No competition from this one 
Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons dubiously claimed relatively good track record on predictions br br In his widely reported comments from the January 2 edition of the Christian Broadcasting Network 's The 700 Club , during which he predicted that there would be very serious terrorist attacks and mass killing in the United States in the second half of 2007 , host Pat Robertson boasted that he had a relatively good track record on earlier predictions But a review of Robertson 's 2006 New Year 's predictions undermines that claim He predicted , for example , that br br President Bush is going to strengthen WRONG br br The fall elections will be inconclusive , but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge WRONG br br The war in Iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion We 'll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year WAY WRONG br br Further , as a January 3 Associated Press article reported , Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions br br The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re election Bush won 51 of the vote that fall , beating Democratic Sen John Kerry of Massachusetts WRONG br br In 2005 , Robertson predicted that Bush would have victory after victory in his second term He said Social Security reform proposals would be approved WRONG YET AGAIN ! br br He claims to speak directly with god If so god has quite the sense of humor watching Pat make a fool of himself again and again 
The potential was there I saw Creep and thought , 'Oooh , this is getting interesting' several times Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored , like they never happened The lead character was irritating throughout the movie , and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die There are some genuinely spooky scary moments , but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me It 's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while , but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve br br The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy , but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you 're on to a loser 
A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief 's daughter , leading to much hate and violence br br This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at , though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white , makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it 's press materials pretends it to be br br In short , the plentiful nudity \( the real reason for watching this \) is good Everything else is not There 's definitely better examples of both genres br br More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one , but two members of the Manson family , Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil , who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda stained screens of the Pussycat Theater ! 
Allen goes to the country \( somewhere he hates going in real life \) and has a weekend with his friends which are the usual successful white middle class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films br br I usually find something to amuse in Woody Allen comedies , but here he really falls totally flat on his face Even the one liners seem to have deserted him The really is no plot \( bar bits and pieces of cod Shakespeare \) but Allen seems to use the location to allow a semi mystical air , which just makes the thing even more witless and half baked br br It just does n't work at any level and is just a giant bore The best thing about this film \( apart from the end credits coming up \) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it does n't make for entertainment 
I dont know about you , but I 've always felt drawn to 'ART' cinema The first 'art' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway 's The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover , which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive The film was the ultimate paradox , both beautiful and grotesque this is what 'art cinema' was about , exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose Life , real life , can be like living in a madhouse , and art expressed shows it for what it is I love movies of all types , but especially those that both entertain and have something to say , whether I agree with it 's stance or no br br 8 1 2 WOMEN , is a dry , clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film , unlike what the previews have suggested The main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son , brought together after the mothers' death In the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable , you can feel his pain What happens afterwards is plain by Greenaway standards , the gathering of the harem , observations on love and death , and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh One could argue this , but I feel the movie to be shallow and pointless And the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me The acting for the most part if fine , especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer \( though poor Mandy should put her clothes back on \) What the film lacks is a compelling story , and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch br br While filled with moments of insight , and the occasional taboo , 8 1 2 Women is too cut and paste to be considered art , too bland to considered 'funny' , and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile br br Save your money I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid br br 4 out of 10
Effect \( s \) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes , not only is it possible , it 's required The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st class cinematographer turner director who once showed promise \( Jan de Bont Speed \) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage \( Twister , Speed 2 \) br br Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing Events just happen , good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity br br There really is n't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now Why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake \? 
Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other That 's it For about 5 minutes we see this It 's shot in black and white with tons of half naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music It LOOKS interesting but there 's no plot and really the violence inherent in this got disturbing Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible , boring , stupid and \( ocassionally \) disturbing Really what is the point in all this \? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence I really wish I could go lower than 1 
This is the kind of film one watches in gape jawed , horrified silence , and yet continues to watch , mesmerized , as if watching a train wreck in slow motion And yet , in the back of your mind , thoughts are churning Who on EARTH green lighted this garbage \? br br Some of the preceding user comments say things like , A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy an insult to children everywhere That children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond so WHAT \? One would think that the rash of movie BOMBS based on beloved series \( Rocky and Bullwinkle , Avengers , Flipper , Mod Squad , ad nauseam \) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply ca n't be recreated The films of Laurel and Hardy are readily available on video why bother with this \? br br As for F Murray Abraham , a fine actor of stage and screen well , all I can say is , he must have been in trouble with the IRS br br Run , do n't walk , away from the television if this trash comes on ! 
Wow , this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot , no character development , they possibly had some kind of script but it 's difficult to tell based on the actual end result br br The editing of this movie was really non existent , it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening br br All in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all , has bad acting , bad dialogue , bad everything br br The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor , I think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this br br Unless you are \( like me \) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find , do not watch this Period 
I'm studying Catalan , and was delighted to find El Mar , a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue , at my art house video store br br Hmmm not so delighted to have seen it br br Yes , as other reviewers have said , it 's well made , and beautifully photographed Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent , it 's well acted and convincing \( For the most part , that is Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square , in full view of the dead man 's 10 year old boy \? \) Oh , well minor detail Up to this point , it had something of the feel of a non magical Pan 's Labyrinth , also set in the Spanish Civil War br br Fast forward , and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys , Manuel and Ramallo , both are patients I know , but hey , coincidences happen br br The problem , as with so many Spanish movies \( apologies to Almodovar fans \) , is that with one exception \( Francisca \) the characters are just so dang weird Their motivations , personalities , and dialogue are often simply incoherent br br What 's more , it descends into some horrific wretched excess Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood The reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track If it had been made 40 years ago , the poster would 've said SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE ! ! RAPE ! ! MURDER ! ! MUTILATION ! ! FANATICISM ! ! ANIMAL CRUELTY ! ! BETRAYAL ! ! br br The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable To work , this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters As it is , it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between Brother Sun , Sister Moon and Pulp Fiction If that sounds like something you 've got to see , by all means , enjoy I think I go with something that does n't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom br br As for the Catalan , it 's the Mallorqui dialect , fairly different than the Barcelona dialect , though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it 
Okay , so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out That is actually not the case ! It 's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it 's up to her mother to believe if she 's telling the truth or not br br To be honest , I really enjoyed the concept of this movie They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love hate relationship between mother and daughter I did not however , enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan 's acting In reality , this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else , perhaps a better actress The character of Rachel \( Lohan \) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film br br I do however , think that if you put Lindsay aside , you will enjoy this film The ending is pretty great \( and sad \) 
I saw this when it was in the theater , it started out so strong I mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent AT THE time Now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations , and other related psychological factors Now as I said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining It builds to an excellent climax then IT ends I mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it , besides being a very poetic description In my experience , it was just not strong enough My wife and I were well how can I say this \? We were upset , I mean we paid money , invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent We both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly In fact my wife said it best , it did not end , IT JUST STOPPED ! 
1993 was the year This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas had won an Oscar Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him \? I was actually a paid extra in My Boyfriend 's Back , which was shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown , TX The original title was Johnny Zombie \( thank God the producers had a change of heart ! \) I was in the theater scene I rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters It is more of a comedy than a horror movie But for a good laugh , you might want to check it out Nothing that is even close to Dawn of the Dead or even Shaun of the Dead quality , but the cheese factor is good enough ciao
When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors It was one of many movies I watched with my parents , but this was the only one we walked out of Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently , and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it What a pretentious , ponderous , and painfully boring piece of 70 's wine and cheese tripe Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman , Allen gives us a dark , angular , muted , insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce , estrangement , career , love , non love , halitosis , whatever The film , intentionally , has no comic relief , no music , and is drenched in shadowy pathos This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature , using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman The film is painfully slow and dull But beyond that , I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling , whining , nicotine stained , martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes Everyone is lost and struggling , desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them It 's never about resolution , it 's only about interminable introspective babble It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience 's ability to connect Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance I highly recommend this one if you 're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death Otherwise , let 's just pretend this film never happened 
The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a Swedish film the first being Susan Sontag 's Brother Carl \( which was made in Sweden , with Swedish actors , no less ! \) The results \? Oscar Wilde said it best , in reference to Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell Pretty much the same thing here Interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers \( I'm afraid of my anger Looking into the middle distance I do n't like who I'm becoming \) The directorial quotations \( to use a polite term \) from Bergman are close to parody The incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are , to the point of strangulation \( I read a poem of yours the other day It was in I do n't know The New Yorker Oh That was an old poem I reworked it \) Far from not caring about these people , however , I found them quite hilarious Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen 's earlier films only he 's directed his actors to play the lines straight Having not cast himself in the movie , he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics , intonations , and neurotic habits , turning her into an embarrassing surrogate \( much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity \) br br The basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman 's Winter Light , the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst It all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper , the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc , etc br br Allen 's later serious films are less embarrassing , but also far less entertaining I 'll take Interiors Woody 's rarely made a funnier movie 
Genghis Cohn is a \( very \) mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950 's who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Hitler in the SS The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed br br Otto , the German policeman actually knows this ghost 's name because , the last thing he did before he died was said , in Yiddish , `Kiss my ass' The policeman did n't speak Yiddish , so he asked around until he found the meaning The `kiss my ass' left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian 's name , Genghis Cohn br br There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner , and there are no helpful clues The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich , so the commissioner is a suspect The first man is killed while making love to the butcher 's wife , so the butcher is a suspect But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking br br I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was He seems to be very good natured about it , as if he was just in a mild car accident I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people He uses some of his material from his stand up routing , and I just did n't find it very funny br br I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was The movie turns out to be a murder mystery \( where did this come from \? \) , and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture , but was only skin deep Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches \? Do they all say `shtoop' and `meshuganah' in their daily vocabulary \? Is n't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture \? br br I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley , CA , and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white \( I have no gray or white hair \) There were 18 of us , and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie There were 2 main concerns expressed there 1 The movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 As the Holocaust survivors are dying off , future generations will not know what really happened I thought that this second concern was ridiculous and I told them I thought they did n't need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies , like myself The murder of 6 , 000 , 000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten I write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day 
This was a blind buy used DVD It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play br br It 's bubble headed comedy , but it 's um squalid The plot is ZANY ! , but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch br br Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven , goofy caper film \( I know , I know , the quotes on the box the Academy Award nomination mean nothing \) 
Very funny to watch Beretta 's Island as kind of natural trash film It is like answer to Jess Franko 's type of b movie Bodybuilders strikes back \( ! face to face ! \) to pushers The very very very stupid strike !

Is this film a joke \? Is it a comedy \? Surely it is n't a serious thriller \? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor , but on quite a few occasions the poor acting , poor directing , and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema The plot is acceptable a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna , Austria , and shows what a beautiful city it is Do not waste your time on this film though , unless you are studying how NOT to act , direct or script a film ! 
It 's here finally a movie comes out that I can honestly say is worse than Larry the cable guy health inspector Yet I'm willing to bet the the wayan 's brothers \( hilarious \) will make more money than I ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time , outside of my fifth grade outside the class re enactment of romeo and Juliet I mean really WHY would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to The comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials Final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me And the commercials looked so promising 
Beyond dirt cheap , this shot on video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through It 's got the typical gore that you 'd expect in a zombie movie , but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while br br What 's strange is that this is an amateur German video , and the version I saw is English dubbed ! The dubbers seem to be American fans \( penpals of the Germans \? ! \) who ca n't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy One character \( a white German , of course \) is dubbed by a black guy apparently , who speaks with thick ebonics !

I have not seen this movie in ages but figured I 'd comment on it anyway , mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells The original THE GETAWAY was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1 \) A Sam Peckinpah movie , 2 \) Featured Steve McQueen , Ben Johnson , and Slim Pickens , 3 \) Was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time br br By comparison , the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife , Kim Basinger McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who 's stupid idea it was to make this movie br br Let 's just get it said and out of the way Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King , and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin 's part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role Like someone else points out , Peckinpah 's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action adventure heist genre By contrast Baldwin , Bassinger company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone , with only Michael Madsen 's and James Woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people br br The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words One viewing was more than enough , not just because it did n't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made Peckinpah 's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood , where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing There 's no artistic urgency to it 's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy br br So I do n't know , this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless , artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor actress , which in itself is n't a really good thing I 'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie fall flat with something original This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out , and it 's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it 's release Mr Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood Thank god for Team America for putting him in his place br br 3 10
Wow What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel Here are just a few gripes The screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book Plot has been grotesquely altered Voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages \( which may read well but are not the same when spoken , especially with Chabon 's writing style \) The acting is more wooden than a log cabin \( Esp Bechstein \) This is supposed to be set in 1983 \? \? \?

Ivan Reitman is something of a savior The most tired plots \( Ghostbusters , Evolution \) come to life in his skilled hands Even his occasional flop \( Six Days , Seven Nights \) show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a fairly original plot \( man dumps superhero , superhero gets superpower fueled revenge \) , and shape it into something enjoyable Girlfriend is an exercise in pointlessness The one trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes The film ca n't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama The result is a film the flip flops between both , with neither aspect being very well done Uma Thurman is tops , as usual , and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too , though his slacker antics quickly grow tired What 's even more maddening is that , in certain scenes \( such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall \) , you sense a witty , raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out But seconds later , the magic is lost , gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way 
this film was totally not what i expected br br if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two br br its really strange because i cannot see the point the prequel and sequel lets just say do n't make sense , the do n't even match maybe i am naive but ai n't a vol 1 vol 2 meant to match up br br carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original , and in the prequel he lives and do n't go jail br br the plot was OK , but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film br br i really expected it to end like the other one started br br if some one has a opinion on this post it please 
Hanna Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property The violence is watered down , the stories are formulaic , the animation is bad , the music is obnoxious and repetitive , and frankly , the show just is n't funny br br At the time , H B put every one of its series through the same clich d situations , regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not Thus , Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen \( Hey !

The '80 's were not very kind to one time major star Charles Bronson Starting with 1982 's Death Wish II and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89 , Bronson 's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness D W II left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson 's character 's daughter , \( a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail \) 10 to Midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards Nothing redeeming about it Other films like The Evil that Men Do and the remaining Death Wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge I'm not sure if the producers \( usually Pancho Kohner \) got a kick out of showing a weary looking , senior citizen aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what , but the shoddy craftsmanship \( and terrible scripts \) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br Kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness In this film Bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I 've thankfully forgotten Also depicted is the gang rape of a young Japanese girl \( fortunately , this was off screen , though well implied \) br br What were people thinking when they made this film \? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films \? For anyone interested in his best movies , check out most of the films he made in the '60 's and '70 's like The Mechanic , Death Wish , From Noon til 3 , Once Upon a Time in the West , Red Sun , The Great Escape , The Magnificent Seven , Rider on the Rain , etc , etc

Okay , let me break it down for you guys IT'S HORRIBLE ! br br If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this I'm sorry but this movie is stupid , true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a crock ! A lot of bad acting NOTE The Shower scene Kissing Cousins \? \? \? \? \? \? What kind of line is that \? Slipery when wet \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? Can we say DUH M ! This movie had effort , I 'll give you that , but it was too stupid ! They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually WASN'T FUNNY ! It was pathetic Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast It 's as if they made them look different on purpose or something ! I like watching it when I'm really really really board which does n't happen occasionally For those of you who did like it Okay , what were you thinking \? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar \? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it , DUH ! But this movie does n't , no offense Amy Adams Oh , yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart \? \? \? \? \? UGH ! 
Honestly , this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I have ever seen Partly , because it takes itself so seriously , as opposed to regular light hearted trash , this movies wants you to be emotionally involved , to feel for the characters , and to care about the alleged conspiracy None of this ever even comes close to happening br br MILD SPOILERS br br There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1 \) Incoherent and totally non sensical plot 2 \) Annoying style over substance MTV camerawork 3 \) Moronic characters and plot holes br br Allow me to elaborate br br 1 \) Apparently , when this movies was being made , they could n't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies , the stigmata , or possession So , guess what \? They combined them ! An aetheist gets possessed by a dead person , who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy How a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained , nor even talked about Now , instead of just saying what he wants to say , he gives her the Stigmata WHY \? Why not just spit it out \? Instead , we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices , carving cryptic messages on cars , and writing messages on walls Apparently this priest was also a violent guy , because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters , while talking in that cliched , harsh , possessed voice that we all have heard countless times This also starts to tie into my second complaint , because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata , she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air , and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake \? Why does this happen \? Who knows ! \? ! My guess is that the director thought it looked cool br br 2 \) This movies contains dozens of shots , in slow motion , of course , of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off , and most annoyingly , of water dripping This woman 's apartment is constantly dripping water ! CONSTANTLY ! Logically , the place would probably fall apart with this many holes To sum up this complaint , towards the end , and for absolutely no reason , the camera cuts to shots of water dripping , in slow motion , in reverse ! ! WHY ! \? ! I have no idea ! It has no relevance to anything , and once again , I'm betting it 's because the director thought it looked cool br br 3 \) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science This does n't make sense to me I would think that going to church would be enough , but no , he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest I just do n't buy it Secondly , there are lots of plot holes , a few of which I will elaborate on below For starters , when she first gets the stigmata , the scene ends with her laying unconscious , bleeding Next , she 's in the hospital Who called the ambulance \? Another one is towards the end , when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl He says , Take me as your messenger ! Not a word for word quote , but you get the idea His response \? You have no faith , only doubt ! So , because of this , he possesses an aetheist ! An aetheist has no faith , far less then any scientific priest ! And then , there 's the fact that the object of this movie 's conspiracy , this Lost Gospel \( of St Thomas , I believe \) is available at local bookstores The characters are willing to kill to supress this document , but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it Maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history , where it is n't wide known , but the movie never tries to tell us this , or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document 's uncovering br br In closing , this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree It is my arch nemesis , which I feel the need to insult every chance I get I loathe it Final Grade F
How did this ever come into existence \? I generally love sci F Bigfoot whatever films etc but I still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this The effects were sad , the lines were sadder Avoid at all costs I only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case \( I was looking for the Sasquatch film with Lance Henrikson in it still have n't seen that one \) The idea of the film is actually a good one There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here I just do n't understand how something like this ends up like this Go speak to the film arts English interested students in any high school and you 'll find people who can write a better script

This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly created character in an ill fated movie , thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie The film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events \( including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear \) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is n't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie \( and what a nightmare it is ! \) Furthermore , despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film , there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing , including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded br br All in all , a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to , much less innocent kids 
I do n't remember seeing another murder mystery movie as bad as this This movie , about a medical examiner who investigates his friend 's mysterious death in a car accident , has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting , boring story , lack of suspense , poor humor and no drama I remembered seeing this movie on PAX , a TV station notable for dishing out low budgeted and campy made for TV movies such as this one TV movies , of course , do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the Big Screen But , this movie sure hit all sour tastes The makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making Receipe for Murder a great TV movie the title does offer some suspense br br So , if you want a good recipe , do n't watch this movie This movie alone can kill your TV appetite br br Grade F

A 90 minute cringe fest that 's 89 minutes too long A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility \( an abandoned convent \) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky , witless dialogue that 's straining oh so hard to be hip Mostly it 's just embarrassing , and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat \( a sample of this movie 's dialogue after demonstrating her artillery , fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau 's vigilante character she `any questions \? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck \) Bad acting , idiotic , homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects , it looks like the director 's watched `The Evil Dead' way too many times br br I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they 'll never get back What a turd 
The first one was the best The second one sucked because the dialog was terrible Although , the storyline was n't so bad \( in fact , all story lines are good and bad \) Throughout the movie , I dosed off a few times I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise , but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2 Chris Tucker , too , was n't good And Zhang Ziyi , what can I say , a few lines , terrible acting \( But that 's based on her script \) All the characters there were not that good But , some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes I know that Jackie Chan does n't do those things which is good for him 
this movie was n't absolutely atrocious , but it was pretty bad the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good ! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist , which is sort of his specialty if you do n't know such things D bill forsythe well , i'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film he 's way too good for this kinda stuff , and his role was n't exactly demanding I rented this on the strength of those two leads , and I was n't really disappointed I mean , heck , it 's a movie about a half man half shark It ai n't Shakespeare folks Other than the plot , which is full of holes , and the poor dialogue , I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired there were shots were they were trying to look cool , but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line it was pretty bad but if you are a jeffrey combs fan , this one is worth checking out he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character forsythe ai n't bad either , and either is the female lead heck if i can remember her name though bottom line , i would n't otherwise waste your time 
Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it I find it the most annoying program on TV There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience That way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast It sickens me however to think that they 'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me That is all 
Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy in a film Nonetheless , this picture was far from great as shortly after this , Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives br br Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylor 's partner br br Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows br br Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged , drinking old timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well In his early scenes , Nolan was really doing an excellent take off of Walter Huston in his Oscar winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948 Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton Place br br The writing in the film is stiff at best By the film 's end , it 's the elements of nature that did Taylor in How about the elements of the writing here \? 
I 've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I 've ever seen , \( followed by Peter Pan 2 , and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 \) All these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot , they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes I'm not saying the jokes are bad , but they make up most of the movie The first time I saw the movie , I would have given it a 1 10 But now I think about it , most kids do n't care how good the original movie was , they just care that the movie is entertaining I still think the movie was a bad sequel , but that does n't mean it 's horrible Now I think it deserves a 3 10 
Okay , I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller , although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston I do not think this girl can act in the least Every movie or sitcom I 've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script This movie only had one good thing about it , and that 's that Ben Stiller was in it This plot is so used and abused it 's ridiculous How many movies have this same type of plot \? \? Can we say Forces of Nature \? \? Not only is the plot so old , but the outcome is so predictable , it 's boring I knew everything that was going to happen before it did It was a bore , but watching Stiller is always a delight ! ! !

Forgive me for stating the obvious , but some films are good and some films are bad Of course , there are extremes within those two broad categories Films such as The Godfather , Saving Private Ryan , and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply do n't deserve to be mentioned by name Occasionally however , someone produces a truly woeful film A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be A film that is more than bad Such a film is Maiden Voyage br br Briefly , Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil , scheming ship 's owner Of course , there is an all American hero on board , complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest , who saves the day br br This is a production that plumbs new depths Everything about it is bad The acting , the direction and the so called plot are breath takingly poor In short , it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings br br Yes , it 's that bad br br I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film However , its dumber than dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean br br Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard What would you do \? I do n't know about you , but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea Not this guy He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate \( for him \) results Enough said Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team 's lives

I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it , and that it was supposed to be a horror movie br br Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes , what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie The Plot was crap , and so was the script The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically br br The cast could n't have been more plastic looking Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker like they dragged on for no particular reason Very poor editing br br All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money Boo 
Well now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his House of 1 , 000 Corpses crapfest , I can now rest in peace Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in The House of Seven Corpses , but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot \( ha ! \) anyway , to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former abode ! In Hell House \( sorry , I do n't remember the actual name of the residence \) , a bunch of mysterious , unexplained deaths took place long ago some , like arthritic Lurch stand in John Carradine \( whose small role provides the film 's only worthwhile moments \) , attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum The result comes across like Satan 's School for Girls \( catchy title made for TV production values intriguing plot \) crossed with Children Should n't Play With Dead Things \( low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead \) trouble is , it 's nowhere near as entertaining or fun The House of Seven Corpses is dead at frame one , and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis , dragging us along for every aching second 
Hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named James Bishop \( Matt Stasi \) takes up his residency at St Andrews insane asylum , or 'mental illness facility' as they like to call it there With nearly 600 patients Bishop meets his boss Dr McCort \( Bruce Payne \) is put to work , he gets ward 'A' where some seriously deranged dangerous patients are held If that was n't bad enough during his first round of visits Bishop finds a dead body has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room Bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings on at the asylum soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them br br Known as Asylum of the Damned in the US this supernatural horror film was directed by Philip J Jones I sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it The script by Matt McCombs takes itself pretty seriously I quite liked the basic idea behind some of it 's ideas but there are a few things which work against it For a start the film is just too slow , the story is pretty good does n't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going I was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute I also thought the so called twist ending was far too predictable the ending itself far too bland forgettable It 's a shame because I liked the story , the character 's , the setting some of the ideas but it 's simply too slow frankly dull to keep one entertained over it 's 90 minute duration It 's one of those films which I would like to recommend but in all honesty I ca n't br br Director Jones does a good job , this is actually a well lit quite atmospheric film I would n't say there 's anything scary here I'm not sure if Hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it was n't they did a great job on the sets the film looks pretty good overall Unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action , there are two hand print shaped wounds a severed tongue that 's it , absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment Depending on who you believe which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good , well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror I was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible CGI computer graphic although it 's an impressive suit It all depends on your expectations I suppose br br Technically the film is good , it looks nice enough the lack of CGI computer effects is something I welcome The acting is n't great though , it certainly could have been better br br Hellborn is a film that disappointed me , there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good I sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience I 'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone 
 Contains miner spoilers br br I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons , The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script , god only knows why the writer \( s \) thought dialogue such as No do n't go out there do n't go out there she 'll get you if she gets you she 'll kill you and if she kills you you 're dead is of movie quality br br This film displays very little character development and to be honest I could n't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities' All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls are n't crying their arguing when they do converse the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated \( appropriate subjects when you 're being chased by a psychotic killer \) br br The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits \( although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven \) br br The camera work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through But due to a very shaky camera , grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic It 's one thing to make a film subjective but it 's another to have action on the screen that an audience ca n't decipher because of the poor cinematography br br I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality There are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting , poor scripting , shoddy camera work and no story In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying , arguing , aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations However , how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car

The plot is just plain BAD Bad by way of the superhero cheesiness , bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed , bad in its character interactions , all topped off by a half explained story I quickly lost interest in br br The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top Lots of blood , gore \( severed body parts aplenty \) , explosions , and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie `Black Mask' delivers For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma , nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability br br Normally a Chinese knockoff of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film , sadly `Black Mask' proved to be an exception to that rule Indeed the antagonist of this movie , by the way he dresses , his long straight hair , and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne However the villain is n't on screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile I am assuming the likeness to Ozzy was intentional in addition to the villain 's look , he also ran a satanic looking hideout So much more could have been made from the Ozzy Osbourne villain gimmick ! If only the writer , director , or ANYONE had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film 's arch villain ! br br `Black Mask' was the first Jet Li film released on video in the USA after Lethal Weapon 4 , and I'm glad I stayed away from it until now It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor If you want to see Jet Li at his worst , rent `Black Mask' and `The Evil Cult' and make it a double feature or horror , both intentional and unintentional Otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of Jet Li , and have plots that are semi well thought out and plausible 3 9 stars 
Sadly it was misguided This movie stunk from start to finish It was hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon I LOVED her Then the next thing I found she did a spread in Maxim and she was gorgeous ! I have n't really heard anything about her until I watched this movie on accident I could n't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it Everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship Too bad I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie 
This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action , the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand up and as a talk show host , but he just cannot act He is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one liners which , by the way , are n't very funny And seeing him run \( even back then \) is not a pleasant sight In addition , I have a feeling that Pat Morita at least by today 's standards does n't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese Do n't even get me started about the story I give it a 2 out of 10 
Goodnight , Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant , gruff old Tom \( who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold \) our tale begins br br And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is In fact it 's just the old odd couple buddy formula Are n't any new stories being written \? br br As I suggested there 's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London 's citizens file politely into air raid shelters Even when the local schoolteacher 's husband is declared missing presumed killed , he is later restored to life br br I found `Goodnight , Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent br br Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one br br 
The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very much similar to the original Corpse Grinders , what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens br br It is my belief that this film would be the 1 worst film on IMDb if anyone had actually watched it The plot is disconnected and , in several \( way too many \) instances , makes absolutely no sense whatsoever The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous \( but still somewhat better \) film br br I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh 
I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about , to prevent it from happening again I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK The movie was pretty terrible All clich , no real plot Historical and technical inaccuracies abound Look up the technical specs on DE 529 , or any Everts class Destroyer Escort , and you will see what I mean I now its black history month in the US , and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this , but the history of this ship is not that great They did some escort work , chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed Sorry , but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for This movie makes them look like whiners Let the name calling commence , I can handle it 
The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche 's work and personality , psychoanalytical techniques and Vienna 's history Take a well know genius you have not read , describe him as demented , include crazy physicians to cure him , a couple of somewhat good looking women , have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache , have every character speak with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams , include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one \( Freud \) , mention a few words used in the genius' works , overdo everything you can , particularly music , and you are done Audience , please stay away 
In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego , only beaten by the new king kong movie Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights Brandon Routh was the worst superman I 've ever seen , from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat He looks just silly wearing the costume But enough about him , Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane , she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter , but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl The plot was weak and predictable \( WOW , He is actually supermans son , who would have ever thought \) and the acting was horrible This movie has one good thing going for it , and it 's name is Kevin Spacey His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie What this movie needed was the cast of lois and clark \( except Kevin Spacey of course \) and a different story I watched this movie after watching the hills have eyes and I was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that 
Because some people , like me , like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it , including the ending Anyway , here 's the ending as I remember it , because I could n't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV But I 'll tell ya , it sure scared the little kid that I was , and I thought about it for days afterward , and it still stands out in my mind to this day , even though some of the details are a little vague Abe Vigoda was in this movie \? I do n't remember that ! I did n't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie , and I LOVED Dark Shadows So , at the end , the lead character \( Belinda Montgomery \? \) is lured by the Judge \( Joseph Cotton , I'm guessing , even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades \? \) to the wedding place , which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind \? Maybe I 've got that wrong and Shelley Winters is there laughing , and the Judge has a cape on , and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him , and he throws back the cloak , and he has goat legs , and he announces he 's actually her father , the Devil , and she 's played right into their \( the satanic cult 's \) hands , because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with \( I guess that 's Robert Foxworth \) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to , The Demon with Yellow Eyes , and yep , sure enough , they show Robert Foxworth , and his eyes glow yellow There are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film Everyone is laughing and rejoicing , except for Belinda Montgomery , who is very unhappy , and cries or screams or something , and that 's the end The bad guys win 
I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance Quite a few people walked out , and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end Of the 60 or 70 films I 've seen at this festival , Frownland is among the worst br br At 106 minutes , it is at least 95 minutes too long You get to watch the main character 's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate , in extended real time The same grimaces , hand over mouth motions , kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again WE GET THE POINT br br One site actually compares this work to early Mike Leigh What drugs would you have to be on to make that statement \? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song , maybe you 'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film Unbelievably , this won a jury award at the festival You can bet it did not win an audience award 
I found a DVD of I Dream Of Jeanie in the 1 00 bin at Wal Mart When I saw that it was the story of Stephen Foster , being a musician and music educator , I had to see it I had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover , just that it was a remake of 1939 's Sewanee River Bill Shirley 's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful , sometimes laughable The man has NO testosterone and is a wimp all the way through ! I have a difficult time believing Stephen Foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs without paying him for them ! In addition to that ridiculous notion , there is a nearly 20 minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black faced Christy Minstrels performing Stephen Foster 's songs that was difficult to watch , to say the least I can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time It is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten Fortunately , Stephen Foster 's songs will NEVER be forgotten also , Eileen Christy 's portrayal of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of Hollywood history 
I am a fan of the Nightmare series but this one is horrible The deaths are so trendy If you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated I did like the flashbacks I think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive That would have been more interesting This is a movie you can take or leave Depends on how much spare time you have 
I own almost every Seagal movie \( yes even ones like this that are low budget \) , and I must say , this may be the worst , not only of his movies , but of all movies ever made The only highlight of this film , and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 , is that A it is Seagal , and B Seagal does have some sweet action sequences , specifically in the store , and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people , and do n't even bother with a story line , because the storyline not only stunk , but so did the acting , the fact that F 18 's and F 14 's somehow changed into F 16s , and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F 16 Also the Stealth never had to refuel \? \? \? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point last I checked , Afghanistan has no Air Force , we \( USA \) control the skies Also , this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room , yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret Also , how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck , to the top \? PLease tell us why they jailed him , Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos \( unless they are Owen Wilson \? \) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries , considering Muslims do n't drink alcohol \? Also on top of that , since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge \? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store , and the other 50 people he killed with a knife , as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere 
After the debacle of the first Sleepaway Camp , who thought that a franchise could be born SC II is superior in aspect More inspired killings and just whole lot more fun While that might not be saying much \( compared to the first movie \) , Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rental br br Pros Entertaining , does n't take itself too seriously like SC I Inspired Killings Cons Crappy acting and mullets abound br br Bottom Line 5 10 br br 
End of the World is an uneventful movie , which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth The main character is some kind of scientist , I'm not exactly sure what kind He has two jobs at a government \( \? \) facility guarded by four security men His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space \( although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 \) Job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that 's the best I can figure Apparently the plant is not exactly top secret , as the scientist brings his wife there She hangs out \( they 're on their way to a dinner \) while he discovers a message from space Major Earth Disruption , repeated over and over He says something about it being the first message from space he 's ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they 're going to be late for the dinner party So they leave and go to the party \( ! \? ! \) Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake From there , the movie goes nowhere ! Yes , Christopher Lee is in it , but that really does n't help much Besides , Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II This movie is boring , but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Z grade sci fi Plus , there 's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed 
And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing The acting and sound is awful This might qualify for a so bad it 's good point of merit , , , for some However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap it 's just soooo cheap , I think that 's my major complaint The dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times you startled me is used The child actress is seriously god awful I pray her acting career ended here her line DONUTS ! I HATE DONUTS is worth repeated viewing however 
A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town , and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo , both zombie related But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too br br The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen In fact I must confess , so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage And there was a lot of that , believe me It runs for just 69 minutes , and there is still tons of filler You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups , plenty of dull kissy kissy scenes between goofy teens \( that rhymed , tee hee \) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors br br As for the title characters , they barely even have a footnote in the film Why , you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature ! Though , considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are \( amongst other 'delights' \) , maybe that 's a blessing in disguise br br And to top it all off , it looks likes it 's been filmed on someone 's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube Jerky camera work , scratches on the print , flickering lights I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001 , and not 1971 Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date ! br br If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film , then go ahead YOU try sitting through it , I betcha you wo n't even make it to the first appearance of the blue smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it , and honestly you 'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror In fact , do n't for surprised if it packs it 's bags and leaves in the morning , leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life You have been warned 0 10 br br P S What kind of 18 rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene \? ! See , the movie ca n't even get that part right 
Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies One thing he ca n't do is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta Joe Don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on The movie is quite bad and you wo n't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don 's character You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever 
Literally every aspect of this science fiction low budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors , contemporaries , and those to follow Bad special effects , a weak storyline , ridiculous amounts of blood and gore , annoying and pointless characters , all that you can expect Attack of the Sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction The cats escape and begin to kill people , the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them , and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats br br Special effects wise , the film is about an average achievement given its budget The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI Amazingly , though , the cats look more realistic in an up close , detailed shot rather than the longer , more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful Just as you 'd expect , they attack , rip off some arms and legs , and leave very little behind This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock br br The plot and characters are just as horrendous We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt And take it very , VERY seriously Even so much as to trespass on private property , tamper with security systems , and steal Why are they taking a simple game so seriously \? Did I miss something \? Was there money involved \? Or were they sent to do it \? I do n't know , I could barely follow the film But it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it Even so , they went too far for normal br br Attack of the Sabretooth is a very poor film Even for a low budget sci fi flick , it is a very poor and cheap example It will bore most viewers to tears , might be attractive for some , and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through And keep in mind , this is not a comedy , this is a cheap horror flick , so it 's not suppose to be comical 
I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off How any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me I know that the intent of the movie is to shock , but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive \( holding back vomit as I type \) PLEASE ! I shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point No wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in HMV I really have no desire to see any other movie by this Uwe person Anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy Period 
I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure A horrible joke of a film , I cringed throughout Terrible , trite , distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths br br The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film However , he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused , and also demanded they stop using his name as a source \( it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved \) br br One scene shows Hitler beating his dog There is not one source for this Hitler loved animals above people He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe , banned vivisection and animal experimentation He was also a vegetarian br br The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce , involving bribery Utter lies He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time br br There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece Not one br br Apart from these , Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick br br If he was even half as ignorant , demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed Never mind become the leader of Germany br br Honestly , this film was utterly terrible br br Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth 
Want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work \? Just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman 's club That 's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end This is the worst slasher film I have ever seen , but every time I was ready to switch the channel , they 'd add another scene with the workout girls and I 'd stay put As a slasher film , Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of As a showcase for beautiful girls working out , it is a success Strong recommendation to avoid , unless the thought of half the film being a big T A show appeals to you 
I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie ! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A pix entertainment , and without exception , everything this company deals with is pure crap ! First , and this is very important , never ever watch this movie sober ! Why would you \? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies , this one I feel was made intentionally bad I just ca n't get over how fake the snowman is , which is why its always shown only briefly , the way it moves is the best ! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap , becuz that was made too be a good movie , and that version is as bad as this 
The movie has one nude scene A man sitting on the edge of the bed , with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen It is quite a long scene What was the point \? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it was n't funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute br br The movie is cold None of the characters are even likeable Audrey Tatou is cute , of course , but her character is an unhappy girl br br I really would not recommend this movie I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust , educated French family and he looks down on these characters br br 
This might be the worst film ever made , and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone Streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study Judaism The soundtrack is torturous , featuring Barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film And do n't even get me started on the plot You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible The rampant ego of Streisand , thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights , led to this disaster I'm pretty sure the novelist , Isaac Bashevis Singer , hated this film and never forgave Streisand I ca n't blame him This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' being played backwards on an old turntable It 's truly that bad I'm amazed that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended 
That song keeps humming in my head Not the greatest song , but it 's the 80 's This movie is about a lead singer who supposebly gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band The lead singer whos name is Billy Eye \( yeah , right \) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time Billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think theres something wrong with her and that shes imagining things She finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if he 's still there She sees that he 's dead but still see 's and hears his voice During the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this , Billy has a brother named John \( right again \) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy The ending is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden But I like it anyway I watch it for the song I wish I had it 
The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable Nothing has changed in Fitz 's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting br br I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in England Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police \? It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation br br The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible , sometimes bordering on silliness , and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one Sad 
I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people , being killed , taking drugs and talking trash br br I do n't agree with that because the film actually had more to it , but it a way , I can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot which is a point i agree with br br It is self indulgent Stone at his best He really wanted to show , not only how war leads to death , but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive Unfortunately , the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne , grand standing , Oscar hunting let 's create an enduring image for my liking br br The problem I have with Stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq In case you 're missing the point , let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers , would you think it was an unjust war \? If that fact alone does n't convince you that it was an unjust war , then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance br br Personally , I do not support America 's decision to go to war in Vietnam , but i certainly do n't subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory I do n't think that motivations are always wrong by default , just because war in itself is terrible br br This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid However , this is not Stones first oddball departure Wall street was a magnificent film , up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well br br But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around And this is why i gave it such a low mark It was virtually story less and ultimately boring unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy 
I like British humor , I believe it 's one of the best in the world I like almost every British sitcom \( okay maybe not Monthy Python , some of the jokes were great , but some of them I did n't understand \) , but this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick This show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel I'm not hungry anymore This is really just disgusting , sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off It was so disgusting , watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car I mean what 's so funny about that \? \? \? It makes me wanna puke No humor , just disturbing images and cheap , toilet laughs I do n't know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest , people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems Garbage 
I love cheesy horror flicks I do n't care if the acting is sub par or whether the monsters look corny I liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end Look , I do n't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me But Dark Floors takes the what is this movie about \? thing to a whole new \( annoying \) level What IS this movie about \? br br This is n't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused , rent this winner 
This is the official sequel to the '92 sci fi action thriller In the original , Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers \( Unisols \) In this one , it 's , I guess , about a dozen years later , since Van Damme has a daughter about that age Now he 's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols codenamed Unisol 2500 , for some reason As usual , something goes wrong the on site super computer \( named Seth like the snake in King Cobra the same year \) goes power crazy , takes command of the Unisols , and even downloads its computer brain into a new super Unisol body \( Jai White \) We 're lookin' at the next step in evolution , folks ! Most of Van Damme 's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol \( pro wrestler Goldberg \) who just keeps on comin' drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go ! Shoot him , burn him forgetaboutit ! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out classed \( he 's even going grey around the edges \) But , though he takes a lickin' , he keeps on kickin' ! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals , and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius , it manages to be consistently entertaining , especially if you 're a pro wrestling fan 
The only reason I do n't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it is n't quite on par with a movie like Manos The Hands of Fate This movie 's greatest crime is the fact that it is head meltingly boring terribly , unforgivably British The premise of this movie sounds potentially promising , the whole teleporting concept , but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting It was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers The actors were wooden , unemotional , and aloof As was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing I never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non existent Nor did I really understand why the melty faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met At least now I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before I cut off their research grants , else they go rampaging about , killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures 
The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet It bears little resemblance to ETA Hoffman 's original story on which it is based br br In the ballet , the story is essentially over by the second half when Clara \( or Marie in this version \) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances br br There 's an infinite variety of stage productions that re interpret the story in myriad ways \( not always successfully \) to compensate for the ballet 's weak libretto br br Balanchine 's version does n't really have any sense of drama or story at all \( despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky 's wonderful first act music \) The result is a completely forgettable first half Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing \( the little that there is of it \) is n't particularly memorable br br The pantomime over acting , particularly of Drosselmeier , which might look passable on the stage , just looks silly filmed for the big screen br br Unfortunately , things are n't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets \( Act II in the stage version \) Although there are a few choreographic highlights , most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring This certainly is n't vintage Balanchine br br Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance , but I have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets Watching this film version of his stage production of The Nutcracker has only re affirmed this view 
Green Street , as it was called in the UK , or Hooligans is a bad film The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England , has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately br br My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters Do n't get me wrong , I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work , but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal , however he spends much of the film placid and cheery , only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans At no point during the film was I convinced that a \) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b \) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold br br The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam Charlie looks the part , and is fairly convincing as a thug Unfortunately , being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England , he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock en y in Marry Poppins Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK , but being from the UK it was a problem I could n't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast , especially the role of Bover The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played With a film like this , you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible , unfortunately , the casting failed Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes \( Jack \) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone 's part You would not be convinced The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities I am no football Hooligan , but I am a fantatical football fan I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be , as such it deem it impossible for a non football fan , who is not a fan of the club in question , is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases My final , and biggest , problem with this film , is the way it portrays football hooligans I take objection to the film 's idea that despite being very violent individuals , hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other This is complete rubbish Football hooligans are complete scum They take football , the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise , frighten and intimidate people They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation They are not brave or loyal , they are cowardly and evil If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club , West Ham , why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans Although this film tries intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport It does not show the poor innocent by standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins lighters glass into the crowd It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone If you want to see a good film about football violence , watch the BBC drama 'The Firm' 
PROS Akshay Kumar 's performance \( is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump AB in their movies together \? \) Some touching scenes in the 2nd half br br CONS The whole 1st hour \( the jokes were flat to say the least \) Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav Major stupidity in AB 's decision making Let me get this straight , he believes brutally insulting his son 's soul in every possible way \( that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair \) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth \? \? WTF \? He considers Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father is soon gonna die due to cancer , but thinks insulting him will make him stronger \? Am I the only one who does n't see the logic here \? Easily the movie 's biggest flaw br br Akshay becoming a stunt man LMAO ! ! We 're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in MBA But when the time arrives to support himself , and his pregnant wife , he becomes a stunt man LOL ! ! How abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field \? Or Heck , anywhere else where ur life is n't in danger \? This is some incredibly dumb writing br br The ending I hate this sort of melodramatic crap Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for AB 's character , which I could n't The entire thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH \( which I hate \) This please feel sorry for the guy with the illness crap has run its course I felt more like puking than sympathy for the OLD man Could n't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd the whole thing br br Bottomline Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie Its obvious director Vipul Shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense Give 'em some decent song picturizations , fancy outfits , plenty of glycerin filled scenes and some star power and they 'll happily lap up crap like this 
I think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for Rogue Pictures' latest release , 'The Return' I myself , along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film On the contrary though , its actually a supernatural thriller Too bad it is not the least bit thrilling br br 'The Return' stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills , a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven It was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met While in Texas on a business trip , she is led by these visions to the murdered woman 's hometown , La Salle There she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions A man by the name of Terry Stahl , who is played by Peter O'Brien Joanna is now on a desperate search for answers A search that could in the end result in her very own murder br br I really do n't know where to begin here folks Which should I mention first \? The atrocious acting , hideous directing , or the terribly bland story \? No matter which one I choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck Adam Sussman 's screenplay is downright moronic Its not interesting Its not compelling Its just plain unpleasant I kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film \( I 've placed quotations around film because I do n't believe 'The Return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it 's foulness \) and at least give it some slight chance of hope , but nothing ever happened I was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze Not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster Of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film I assume this is why the acting was so awful At least that 's what I'm choosing to believe I really hope the cast does n't pride themselves on their performances They need immediate medical attention if they do br br Now the directing was unmistakably bad , but I ca n't quite crucify Asif Kapadia entirely \( Well I could , but I wo n't since I'm such a nice guy \) I look at 'The Return' as a test for Kapadia because for all of you that do n't know , this is his first full length feature film He 's just getting his foot in the door and still learning Next time around , well if there is a next time , hopefully he will have improved vastly The only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of Marcus Nispel 's 2003 re make of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Now that 's nice the film was given that , but unfortunately he still wo n't be receiving any kudos from me for that Copying someone else 's work is n't something I consider to be praise worthy \( Even if it is from a film I very much enjoyed \) br br I think Jim Sonzero 's American re make of 'Pulse' will now have to fork over the title of Worst Film of the Year to 'The Return' It beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way Now I do n't doubt this will make a small , and I mean very small , profit No matter what though , it wo n't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of Gellar 's previous acting effort , 'The Grudge' On that note , there 's one last thing I 'd like to add I can honestly say I had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'The Return' That is something I never wish to experience again , along with the film itself 
We went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of `My favourite Martian' We had our 6 year old daughter with us She wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents ! The parts we did see were only occasionally humorous , mostly either too silly or gross I would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9 12 , if that It 's definitely not suited for younger children From what I 've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to relive the past you 'll probably be disappointed 
This is the second British Rank film to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham to film All but one story from 'Quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era and the actors speech is decidedly clipped , as only British pre 1950 's actors delivery can be In anycase 'Trio' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation br br One of the problems these two films ca n't overcome is that their source material was written 25 30 years prior to the films Consequently , by the 1950 's Maughm 's \( pre war \) popularist small morality storyteling seemed rather quaint , if not downright coy 
I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the BBC in the weeks prior to it starting I watched it despite the fact that I do n't like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes \( sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor 's new clothes with this author 's work \) I admit that the acting is excellent , it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it however I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production The 'explicit' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV several times so it was nothing very shocking I'm afraid Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content I'm afraid 
If you loved Pulp Fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film I liked the quirky story \( even though I feel that Pulp Fiction was the most over rated movie since The English Patient \) and found the characters unrealistic but interesting It 's not On the Waterfront or Citizen Kane and is burdened by European pretentiousness But the worst part by far is the hand held camera It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end I do n't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great If you are prone to motion sickness , stay away , the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes 
Inept , boring , and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student Cassie \( Melissa Sagemiller \) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend Sean \( Casey Affleck \) br br I ca n't begin to tell you how bad this is nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value I did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing \( then again , their roles are no good \) To promote this as a horror film is a joke Where are the scares \? There 's no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but that 's about it br br How on Earth did this project get the green light \? Writer director Steve Carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that I can sense Worst of all , the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless br br The alleged killer cut that I watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium br br 1 10
Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story br br To have a chance at obtaining an education , Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which is n't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy , anyway At her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she 's a guy br br Do n't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs' male friend thinks she 's a man , but pins 'him' to the ground , sits on top of 'him' , and looks affectionately into 'his' eyes snicker br br Mediocre film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting 
Jamie Foxx is fun but this movie has been done before The bad guy plays a malkovichian character from In the Line of Fire The cops will do anything to find the bad guy and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf 
blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone i ONLY watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say , the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched in fact , i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re enactment scenarios on the FBI Files show by far , the worst re enactments \( really only Arrest and Trial can possibly be as bad at re enactments \) i did n't even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until i looked the movie up here on IMDb , but its obvious why he has n't made any movies since i hope he is a good singer 
If this is the first of the Nemesis films that you have seen , then I strongly urge you to proceed no further The sequels to Nebula prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is bottom of the barrel This movie tries , but it 's just not worth your time , folks Take a nap instead 
If this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs , it fails I was ready to start using them I got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did This movie is neither horror or drama It 's just the paranoia of meth users This movie may win an award for the using the F word so many times and so uselessly It was not well stated , but I felt like they were making Meth to replace Meth they owed to someone Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless The ending really made no sense The movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth head I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average 
Omen IV The Awakening starts at the 'St Frances Orphanage' where husband wife Karen \( Faye Grant \) Gene York \( Michael Woods \) are given a baby girl by Sister Yvonne \( Megan Leitch \) who they have adopted , they name her Delia At first things go well but as the years pass Delia \( Asia Vieria \) grows up Karen becomes suspicious of her as death disaster follows her , Karen is convinced that she is evil itself Karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next Antichrist gets a shock when she finds out who Delia 's real father was br br Originally to be directed by Dominique Othenin Girard who either quit or was sacked was replaced by Jorge Montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone 's guess as Omen IV The Awakening is absolutely terrible a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors The script by Brian Taggert is hilariously bad , I'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe As a serious film Omen IV The AWakening falls flat on it 's face it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof , I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face to face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed I thought it was absolutely hilarious ridiculous in equal measure Then there 's the pointless difference between this the other Omen films in that this time it 's a young girl , the question I ask here is why \? Seriously , why \? There 's no reason at all is n't used to any effect at all anyway Then of course there 's the stupid twist at the end which claims Delia has been keeping her brother 's embryo inside herself that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of Satan worshippers it has been implanted in Karen so she can give birth to the Antichrist is moronic comes across as just plain daft At first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later br br It 's obviously impossible to know how much of Omen IV The Awakening was directed by Girard Montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it 's a shabby , cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made for TV it shows with the bland , flat unimaginative cinematography production design Then there 's the total lack of scares , atmosphere , tension gore which are the main elements that made the previous Omen films so effective br br The budget must have been pretty low the film looks like it was The best most stylish thing about Omen IV The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path 's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything I have to mention the music which sounds awful , more suited to a comedy is very inappropriate sounding The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys br br Omen IV The Awakening is rubbish , it 's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious just ends up coming across as stupid The change of director 's probably did n't help either , that 's still not a excuse though The last Omen film to date following the original The Omen \( 1976 \) , Damien Omen II \( 1978 \) The Final Conflict \( 1981 \) all of which are far superior to this 
Oh god , what a horrible , horrible film Meant to be a comment on the state of society , it 's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most obnoxious part , written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful Rather , these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting , condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer 's throat br br Also , a point to would be filmmakers Long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art Neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity br br If anyone out there is interested in watching this film , please do n't Seriously Please You have better things to do 
First of all , f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft br br Secondly , the f14 's and f18 's cannot change their appearances they are not transformers br br Thirdly , the f16 has only one m61 cannon , not two br br Last but not the least , at the end of the film , Seagle selected sidewinder missile But somehow when he pulled the trigger , the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick As I have the experience of seeing f18 's and f14 's being mysteriously transformed into f16 's , this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me However , there is still one question I have to ask How did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 br br When students hand in really bad work , teachers assign 0 's Now I think for the sake of properly marking this film , IMDb should seriously consider adding a '0 10' option Otherwise , it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 
Olivier Gruner stars as Jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a Mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it 's laughable Bad acting , bad plot and bad fight choreography make Angel Town a Turkey 
I should explain why i gave this piece of art 1 star rating out of possible 10 Simply because it 's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10 10 explanations anyway would have followed br br I am not fond of these pointless gore movies like HOSTEL or so i think that 's disgusting and pretty terrible \( in all the possible contextual meanings \) , but as i found out after watching this movie there is a genre called historical drama and probably it would have been the case of 10 10 as it has plenty of it and Tarantino would have been more than happier with it \( and made Kill Bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible \) but the thing about historical drama genre is that it 's a sub category of the trash movies where John Romero is the undead gory emperor of the guts and so automatically it ca n't be rated as your default movie as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you ca n't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so , or it was simply bad it 's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting , bad screenplay and bad everything else And by some turn of faith i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go the day is saved ! but that 's definitely an opinion of mine and does n't have match with anyones' else br br What i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie then Fellini 's Casanova is definitely the choice , but heed my advice and do n't rate it by default means 
Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide It 's a very gory , bloody sequence Then it jumps to present day well 1982 to be precise Ted \( Edward Albert \) , wife Laura \( Susan George \) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubby 's work They rent a house and surprise ! surprise it just happens to be the house where the murders took place ! The three dead people are around as ghosts \( the makeup is hysterically bad \) and make life hell for the family br br Sounds OK but it 's really hopeless There 's a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious ! They look so fake I swear I saw the strings pulling one along and they 're muttering ! ! ! ! ! There 's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes \( probably just to show off George 's body \) , another one about 40 minutes later \( but that was necessary to the plot \) and a really silly exorcism towards the end The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed br br As for acting Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend But George as always is terrific in a lousy film She gives this film a much needed lift but ca n't save it I'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing That aside , this is a very boring film 
This movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom It is yet another thinly veiled , evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys \( the believers \) suddenly vanishing and the bad guys \( the non believers \) left behind It 's an interesting concept , especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard \( needless to say that sinner does n't disappear either ! \) Unhappily , with all the pilots being non believers , the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over Though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating , as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag , the acting is horrible and the obviously computer generated simulations are very fake looking Plus it 's yet another movie shot in Canada that purports to be New York City Spare me I 'll just read the Bible 
I went to see this a few days ago , and it 's hard to forget that film for the wrong reasons This film is supposed to be funny , it 's not , not a single laugh in the theatre \( perhaps for jos garcia and g rard Depardieu \) , and it 's boring , boring , boring It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying They just talk to fast and do n't open their enough for us to understand I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny what , what did he say , and i'm french I hate to say that , given the fact that i think good films are made here , but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film \( if ever shown outside of France \) br br We 're deeply sorry for that cr p 2 10
Mislead by the terrible lie on the cover , fun as American Pie , my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy and this is definitely not one You probably wo n't laugh one time if you 're not one of those Jackass like ever teeny minds It 's not even an erotic movie , which would at least been something , given that it 's about sex br br So , what is this \? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity \( zero in originality , I remember Losing it for one \) and his gang of friends The rest of the characters \( i e the girls \) just come and go for no credible reason Come on , there are even Dwarfs \( so simple dwarves are fun ho ho \) The acting is very TV like \( as is the video look throughout the movie \) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls br br Awful movie Amateurish , badly produced , and over all NOT FUNNY Kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes Other than that , do n't even think of renting this movie 
I 've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time , and while this is n't the worst of the bunch , it 's certainly in the lower half The script starts off OK A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern , hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife Cute huh \? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients Turns out that there 's a demon on the basement that 's harvesting people 's souls It 's the job of the 1 doctor , 1 nurse , and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs , do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out , and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid , I was begging for it to be over There was still an hour to go It looked like a half an hour Tales From the Crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey \( The Green Mile \) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet , this movie fails in every possible level I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason 1 \) His fianc is pretty hot , she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 \) The movie actually looks OK , a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras br br In the end , avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass \( which I do , and I still felt cheated \) As a bonus drinking game , you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi \( Dr James Bishop \) shakes his head while talking You 'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie 
Hey , br br If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard Cohen ! This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers \( some of them questionable \) talk about themselves Puleeze sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high who cares about you , what about Leonard \? Guess what people , if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you I found particularly insulting the parading of U2 's members as if that would add credibility to this movie NOT Leonard does n't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film Gee , what a concept ! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable br br Cohen fans , do n't say I did n't warn you ! 
 You ca n't exactly shove her out of the way , because she 's old and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with is n't really her fault Nevertheless , in these circumstances it 's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake So it is with The Pallbearer , an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent 's funeral br br To further extend the metaphor \( perhaps unwisely ! \) like the old lady , one starts to feel with the set up of the film that its demise cannot be far away Sure enough , this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted , slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments , as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction Downhill Its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off again , not unlike the grim inevitability of death ! br br Returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels' , the main character , Tom , is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life If there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic' , then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer 's other more famous role To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE 'clueless' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as Schwimmer , but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place br br How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he 's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable' , even if the situations are n't \? A man with a longstanding high school crush on someone he has n't seen for years Sound familiar \? Paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'Rachel' role , but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable DIFFERENCES present were n't so incongruous as well Unfortunately , the romantic element is so well worn it 's threadbare , and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff' ! 2 10 
This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet , I like BARNEY more than this movie The graphics suck , half the movie is animated , the deaths suck , and over all , I was ready to SUE the people that made this movie !

Please do not waste your time watching this movie , you will regret it You want to know why this movie sucks \? Well , the cover sucked , the graphics sucked , the blood looked \( I mean is \) ketchup , the people tried to blow themselves up , the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal I mean , there was a 5 ft tiger running straight at a woman , she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away ! WAIT TILL YOU CAN Actually HIT IT ! The acting was horrible too Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie , and this just had to go and ruin it 
Billy Crystal co wrote , co produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons , adult irresponsibility , and growing old Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack \( ha ha \) which causes him to seek out his estranged father \( Alan King \) , a movie extra who fancies himself a big star The script is sub Neil Simon nonsense with one liners galore , a flat , inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler \( stuck in sitcom mode \) , and family conflict at the ready Crystal and King try their best , but King is over eager and frequently over the top JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles , but manages to bring her innate , down home class to the proverbial girlfriend character It 's a comedy , I guess , but one that blinks back the tears shamefully from 
The movie 's premise is spooky a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar br br But as soon as the movie begins , a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a C type Sci Fi TV movie It 's a big Star Trek and a bit X files , but more than anything else it 's boring br br When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche It looked more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci Fi TV series No suspense and no thrills , but not for a lack of trying Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters br br Do n't waste your time 
I found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions \( deliberate and otherwise \) effect the lives of the others The film 's premise holds great promise but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it As a result , I never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally By the end of the movie , I had a so what attitude about all of them A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great , but as it stands it is merely so so
the only thing great about the movie is its title In this case , Snake On a Plane is example of not judging the book by its cover , the title says nothing about the movie When I went to the theater , I was n't expecting Citizen Kane , I was expecting Independence Day , a movie that 's pure popcorn fun , but instead , I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called Turbulence Yes , this is how bad SOAP is The only thing make SOAP better is its title And it 's not even the apporiate title for the movie , the was n't even a glimpse of snake or plane 40 minutes into the movie ! What a false advertising ! If it was n't for its title , SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B grade summer movie And the R rating \? It has to be the most undeserved R rated movie of all time ! The makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a R , All of the violence are kept pg 13 level You know what 's really R rated \? The R rated superstar Edge ! See him at Summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake ! 
the only thing that frequently pops into my head while i'm writing this review is , i 'll never get that hour and a half back ! ! ! to indicate that i'm not just blowing air , i 'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy \( cube and hypercube \) ! cube was n't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws ! hypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cube \( the story was better \) ! but cube zero in comparison to it 's predecessors really is n't worth sh t ! a complete lack of good fx , a very f ck d up script and just plain old bad acting do n't combine well ! example all of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if should happen and then it would happen , so it 's not very original neither ! my advice do n't lose that hour and a half i lost ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever It is not that i do n't like cult movies I do But nothing happens in the film One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever endless times without dialog And the car How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car \? It is a two seater ! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful , but not in a movie , the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie , so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway br br I would not recommend it , as it is a waste of your time
The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell \( Lochlyn Munro \) has brought a farming property which he is renovating planning to turn into a holiday inn , he is joined by his girlfriend Darcy Wagner \( Chandra West \) her young 12 year old daughter Pamela \( Nicole Munoz \) who arrive to help for the weekend While exploring the property Pamela meets another young girl named Emma \( Jianna Ballard \) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home , she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the Tooth Fairy who takes baby teeth from children then kills them Pamela is worried becomes even more so when she falls off her bike her last baby tooth falls out , it 's not long before the evil ghost of the Tooth Fairy has her eyes on Pamela 's tooth just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across br br Directed by Chuck Bowman I thought The Tooth Fairy was just another poor straight to video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other 's which litter video shop shelves fill late night obscure cable TV schedules , basically it 's not very good The script by producer Stephen J Cannell , Corey Strode Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snooze fest for the first 40 odd minutes , nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone It introduces the character 's , sets the Tooth Fairy legend up that 's it The second half of the film improves slightly but even then it 's hardly spectacular stuff , there are a few decent set piece gore scenes but apart from that it 's all very predictable forgettable stuff The character 's are n't great most of them are there purely to be killed off , the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Tooth Fairy herself , it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth \? What happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 \? Why has she come back as a ghost \? Despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself using weapons to kill people , there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment br br Director Bowman does OK , it 's reasonably well made there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about There 's nothing I would describe as scary or atmospheric in here do n't take any notice of the comparisons between this Darkness Falls \( 2003 \) as besides the teeth thing they 're quite different The gore is OK , someone is shoved into a wood chipping machine , there 's a decapitation , someone has their penis chopped off the best scene when someone is nailed to a door then has their stomach hacked open with an axe their guts slide out br br With a supposed budget of about 1 , 500 , 000 The Tooth Fairy is generally well made but there 's nothing special on show here The acting is n't anything great but it 's not too bad unusually I did n't find the child actors that annoying so that 's something I suppose br br The Tooth Fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight to video horror fare that seems everywhere these days , if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it 's pretty poor forgettable stuff 
Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns He was a great actor , From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm are a proof of that , but he did not have the physique of a western hero , you identified him as an urban guy But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho , the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault I blame it on two factors a \) the story was too unusual , specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern , to break away from it the film has to be very good b \) the story is not convincing , it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible , why all the gunfighters have not adopted it \? I think that this film should not have been withdrawn , because any film with Sinatra is worth seeing , and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
may contain spoilers ! ! ! ! so i watched this movie last night on LMN \( Lifetime Movie Network \) which is NOT known for showing quality movies THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL ! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing , as it was terrible could this movie contain any more stereotypes \? \( harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor , catholic family with priest sons , big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family 's house , mexican whores , bad guy who is really a softie at heart , incredibly bad country accents \) GAG ! ! ! ! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it , i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it anyway , the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick 's beauty i suppose pollack 's and nemec 's acting is okay , but they have a horrid script to work with unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents \( the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang \) i think that the accents were there \( in supporting characters like mary margaret 's date and john \) and were unnecessary they were also very very bad i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive , i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful capitol building , the UT tower lit up for a winning football game , etc none of these things were there also , it takes about 5 6 hours to drive to mexico from austin at one point in the movie , michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark \( during the summer and early fall it does n't get dark in austin until 9pm or so \) , spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican \( is there any other kind \? \) whores , and then return to austin by dawn while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely and if anyone has started school in the hill country \( usually the third week of august , but may have been in september in 1960 \) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets ! ! ! ! ! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 degrees only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience 
In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass , this film was probably quite revealing in its day However , I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica 's bag , since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage , Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan He organises the inhabitants into community action , and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me , as these people have far more important things to think about , like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from Anyway , De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are It 's all down to capitalism of course , and in order to illustrate this , he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land Brilliant ! To his credit , though , by this time he has given up on making a serious film , and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures , all fur coats and cigars They want that land , but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense By a bizarre stroke of luck , his old , deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove He uses it to shower gifts on his mates , who prove just as greedy as the cigar men I reckon this film was a missed opportunity To address the theme of poverty , as not many film makers had done until then , and then get caught up in a fairy tale , to me seems a bit daft How come 'great' directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here \? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks De Sica , however , is proclaimed as a genius for this Surely the fact that these people are so poor , that their faith is unswerving , and that miracles never happen to them , is enough for any story teller to work on br br 
I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene This film immediately leaves you scratching your head as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers , machine guns , rifles , handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck Bob \( Waldemar Torenstra \) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend since they are with hand throwing distance they ca n't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it 's opening The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen \( Sophie Hilbrand \) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers Avoid this film I would give it a 4 0 out of 10 
Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan , whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown \( for example , John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima \) tried his hand at a big musical with I Dream of Jeanie Harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and , as it turned out , virtually no future , he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great American songwriter , Stephen Foster br br Bill Shirley is the young , lovestruck Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy His intended is Inez McDowell \( Muriel Lawrence \) whose pesky younger sister , Jeanie \( Eileen Christy \) , is slowly realizing she 's in love with the nearly impecunious song smith Foster is in love with Inez who is revolted by the composer 's Number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune , O Susannah Enter minstrel Edwin P Christy \( Ray Middleton \) to help launch the profit making phase of Foster 's career br br This is , by the musical film standards of the early Fifties , a big production The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings The singers are n't half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin br br But this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum South The biggest number features black face for all on stage , an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism Were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality , the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution br br I Dream of Jeanie apparently sank into the studio 's vault with barely a death whisper Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere 4 99 it 's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of America 's great crime , slavery br br This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v Board of Education Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater 
This video nasty was initially banned in Britain , and allowed in last November without cuts br br It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979 , Ursula Buchfellner The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures I am not sure what the purpose of that was It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene br br Laura \( Buchfellner \) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom Peter \( Al Cliver The Beyond , Zombie \) is sent to find her and the ransom Of course , one of the kidnappers \( Antonio de Cabo \) manages to pass the time productively , while another \( Werner Pochath \) whines incessantly br br The ransom exchange goes to hell , and Laura runs into the jungle Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal \? Oh , yes , there are cannibals in this jungle Why do you think it was a video nasty ! Muriel Montoss is found by Peter and his partner \( Antonio Mayans Angel of Death \) on the kidnapper 's boat Montoss is very comfortably undressed Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura , who has been captured by now They pass the time having sex , and do n't see the danger approaching Guts , anyone \? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil \( Burt Altman \) br br Blood , decapitation , guts , lots of full frontal , some great writhing by the cannibal priestess \( Aline Mess \) , and the line , They tore her heart out , which is hilarious if you see the film 
I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku , but she only has a smaller part in it , and her character is n't very likable However , the main character , played by Melissa Sagemiller , is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie This is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent She does a very good job br br The story itself is , on the face of it , pretty nonsensical After a car crash , some friends are possibly dead , but keeps on living their previous lives , while all sorts of mysterious things happen Some bad guys are after them , but we never really find out who they are \( possibly they were the ones in the other car , but we certainly do n't hear anything about why they are after them \) The final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious , but I ca n't get anything coherent out of it The opening scene , where the bad guys \( who wear some strange masks \) cut a blond girl 's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who 're trying to pull Cassie \( Sagemiller \) back from the dead but no , that does n't seem to work The bad guys are just bad guys they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice , who the hell needs bad guys \? br br 3 out of 10 
First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie \( nothing less than this available \) The film fails in every department be it screenplay , direction , characterization or acting br br 1 \) To start with , the name of the movie is really C class \( though the movie itself match up to the name \) 2 \) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character 3 \) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50 , 000 on him \( which was convincing \) Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban \( Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero 's and had only few men bikes to commute \( with all automatic guns \) Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time does n't look convincing 4 \) As for Nisha Kothari , somebody needs to tell her that she does n't know acting Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again \? 5 \) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do 6 \) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie 7 \) Legendry role played by Lila Misra \( Mausi of Basanti \) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag 8 \) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru pathetic to the greatest extent br br To summarize , I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic Please do n't waste money and time on this movie I think watching Aap Ka Surror \( which I thought was the worst movie possible \) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters , bad songs and miserable direction br br Thanks , Saurabh
This short spoof can be found on Elite 's Millennium Edition DVD of Night of the Living Dead Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper In execution , it 's a different matter This short did n't even elicit a chuckle from me I really never thought I 'd say this , but Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 In Shocking 2 D was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring br br My Grade F
AKA Mondays In The Sun br br I have no idea what I just watched Three men wander aimlessly and drink , grousing about everything and at everyone in their path This is supposed to be a drama , but what it is , is a total waste of film , without a single redeeming quality br br I have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful , beautiful , and heroic I'm afraid I cannot agree , unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto humans who ever walked br br All in all \? This was not a movie It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience I 've watched this three times , and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage There is nothing profound here , whatsoever It 's crap br br It rates a ZERO 10 from br br the Fiend 
TV pilots , do n't you love them \? Quinn Martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other TV detective movies , but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of MST where it belongs Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find super spy Lovejoy , I mean Tree Zulu and Tso Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else Tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does There 's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine \( required in the 1970 's \) and the show itself is so anti climatic Why did it not go to series \? You figure it out , it 's quite blatant Again it 's fun for MST , but not a lot else ! ! 
Basing a television series on a popular author 's works is no guarantee of success Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis , three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game' Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley , a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand , only to have it replaced by an artificial one Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma \( and looked like one of the bad guys \) while Mick Ford \( who played the irritating Chico Barnes \) made me think of a horse 's arse whenever he was on screen For six weeks , this less than dynamic duo charged about the countryside , foiling nefarious plots to fix races , usually by the same methods blackmail , kidnapping riders or doping horses Yorkshire Television threw money at the show , but to no avail Violent , sexist , far fetched and repetitious , it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard 
i think that 's this is awful produced and directed movie Benicio Del Toro should n't work in production of movies , he should put accent on his acting and that 's it Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution , about it 's ideals , and most important about life of Che Guevara and so on Camera is awful , like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it , music is i do n't know is there some music in the movie \? \? \? \? i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one It 's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever I ca n't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars DISASTER DISASTER DISASTER DISASTER Do n't watch please Save yourself from this misery of movie 
This is definitely one of the weirder 70 's movies out there , and it 's most notable for kicking off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie , especially when the dark , moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things \( as another user pointed out , one of the songs is dedicated to a character , Travis Crabtree , who paddles around in a canoe for a while , then leaves , never to be seen again \) Although it 's painfully dated now , i 's still a fun scary movie to show to kids , and anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot lore or 70 's hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this My favorite part a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door \( ! \? \) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from shock Uh , I 'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious , but whatever br br 4 10 stars , or 7 10 if you like bad Americana 
Ohhh man ! Now this is what I'm talking about ! As far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own A real gem ! br br First off , the film was n't originally in English That 's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional ! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog \( and there is plenty more where this came from \) I'm feeling a little better I'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD ! br br And what drama ! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists br br Scene 1 Scientist You ca n't do that It 'll be a disaster ! Military Officer That 's just science fiction \( he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted \) br br Scene 2 Scientist If you do that many people will die ! ! ! Military Officer you do n't know what you 're talking about \( he does it and many people die \) br br Scene 3 Scientist Do n't do that It 'll kill everyone ! Military Officer That 's nonsense \( he then proceeds to kill everyone \) br br Scene 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \( you get the idea \) br br If that was n't enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics ! In one scene , the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men The leader yells , Go get 'em ! and all 10 army guys , one at a time , drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries ! Instant classic ! br br And do n't worry No attention to detail was left out ! This movie even had a hip upbeat '80 's keyboard synth soundtrack to set the mood ! br br And trust me I realize this review might contain some spoilers , but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade ! A true movie watching experience ! A masterpiece ! Wow ! 
Eyes of the Werewolf \( 1999 \) is a really bad movie The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production Some blind dude gets some new eyes , bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out \? Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what 's up with that female cop \? If you really want to find out , check out Eyes of the Werewolf ! br br Not a bad idea for a movie I just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre production before they decided to shoot the movie 
Story goes like this , Netflix was late sending me my dvds so I went on down to the the analog rental place known as Blockbuster Video They suck you know Real bad , They have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of those So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf , all by its lonesome self I like seeing films based on serial killers Its just a part of humanity that I will never understand , therefore I wanna see that kind of stuff Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first second , it sucks I'm sitting there with my b f and we are like , what is this kind of crap \? Unsteady camera operation , horrible acting , the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead , Then a rat gets stuffed down her throat I really wonder if the director has a hard on for this crap There is nothing decent about this film All I have to say to the director is do you own a freakin' tripod \? Every shot was brutally unstable The music was awful It was like they just decided one day to make a movie They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and act for them Just plain awful If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby NOT what you should be doing for a living SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself Better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with Then you break out your BTK KIller film and say , Wanna see this crappy movie I did once \? 
Along with 2 days in the Valley , I think this is one of worst movies I 've ever seen Just another of the long line of Tarantino rip offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction The atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes , but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the hip quotient You 're better off skipping this one 
Based on Tom Wolfe 's satirical novel that was praised by all \( i have not read it yet \) Tom Hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of NYC Willis stars as the reporter who starts Hanks on his downward spiral The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs either Melanie Griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film This will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor On a scale of one to ten 3
This was awful Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job But then remember that turn in Four Weddings , equally as excruciating Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages , and village greens I mean that school , how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that \? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat \( a nauseating British series set in the 60s \) This film just could n't make its mind up what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women 's friendships If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked \( i say just \) But those scenes just did n't work with the tragedy in the second half I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour A final note what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo \? Not to mention Anna Chancellor Macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream 
A Vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok , and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated \( including women \) Released to theaters just prior to A Star Is Born , which turned his career around , this action drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly off kilter , thoughtless and mean spirited Filmed in Simi Valley , CA , the results are truly unseemly , with redneck clich s and mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage 's script Armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film , including Jan Michael Vincent , Victoria Principal , Bernadette Peters , and , in a bit , Loni Anderson however , the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson , who is gruff and rude throughout It deserves points I suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive in thriller , but the bad vibes \( and the ridiculous climax \) coat the whole project like an ugly stain 1 2 from 
Ironic that Dr Seuss' fable emphasizing the non commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped , marketed , and successful blockbusters of the holiday season The general gist of Ron Howard 's adaptation is that the Grinch 's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who \( played very well by Taylor Momsen \) This movie makes an ardent , ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss' story , but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch , but whether it 's the dialogue , the pacing , or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot , the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly There are some wonderful visuals and the make up work is amazing , yet beyond the technical triumphs there 's an element or two here that 's missing br br Succinctness \? br br Soul \? br br Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25 minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long Howard , Carey , and crew are all very capable and talented , but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product If you must see the feature length version , rent it on video with Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better I give this film three cans of Who Hash out of five 
To summarize this movie Without a real plot , this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes The music is just awful , the humor is n't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks It seems to me , that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy , who thinks that drinking is cool , women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks Also , the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies , other than a few names and Mr Levenstein who is a minor character in this one The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls Do n't watch this movie and do n't be fooled by the 5 4 rating , because it obviously overrated and does n't deserve anything above 2 
I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past And that is the disturbing point , because Columbo is no ordinary detective br br There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing First , I ca n't figure out the title of this movie It is misleading Maybe a better title would 've been The Vanishing Bride or something similar Second , Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason \( to the viewers at least \) why he does it br br I do n't feel betrayed , just disappointed I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo br br 
Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing Apocalypse Now that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie \? br br You have to wonder what the director of The Godfather and The Conversation was thinking when he made this flabby film It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle , playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her , and Turner , the trooper that she is , does what she can with it , but this movie could n't be saved by anyone br br It does n't even have any style to it , and , given its director , one would expect that even if it had nothing else , it would have that br br Grade C 
I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood 's novel 'The Robber Bride' , and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder , and his buddy , an ex cop journalist , tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman 's crazy female friends It 's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms Atwood 's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men , victims of scheming women br br Heh Okay , you got me If these guys are mentioned in the book , and I'm pretty sure they 're entirely made up for the movie , I 'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy Apparently , the three main female characters of the novel are n't enough to carry the movie Zenia 's manipulations are n't interesting unless we see them happen to a man , and a man 's life is screwed up Roz , Charis , and Toni tell their stories to a man Because it 's not important if a man does n't hear them br br I liked the characters in the book It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man 's story I normally do not look for feminist angles on media , and I tried to enjoy the movie as is If I had n't read the book , I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more So if you like the cop and the ex cop , and you want to read more about them , you 're out of luck Read the novel , if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot It 's the same plot the movie excavated it , ironed it , and sprinkled it with male angst It 's like Zenia 's revenge on Margaret Atwood 
A disappointing end to a season that started so well br br Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on TV in any series , where as this was rather bad br br Well I am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment , but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series br br Its almost as if the corporate execs did n't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up They failed and rather spoilt everything br br Lets hope this is not a trend for the future br br Still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done 
This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason , and that is a shame because the 1954 version is , in my opinion , much better I am not denying Barbra Streisand 's talent at all She is a good actress and brilliant singer I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson 's other work and therefore I ca n't pass judgment on it However , this movie leaves much to be desired It is paced slowly , it has gratuitous nudity and foul language , and can be very difficult to sit through br br However , I am not a big fan of rock music , so it 's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris , and judge for yourself

Yes , he is ! No , not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies Pintilie IS THE naked emperor so to speak br br It 's big time for someone to state the truth This impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man 's body His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever It is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies And if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard on ! Did you know that , on the set of Niki Ardelean , he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss , by telling her Oh , Coca , how I wanna f you ! \? She is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction !

A really very bad movie , with a very few good moments or qualities br br It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair , who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks , I'm not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up , and we see she is very pregnant The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie br br She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies ! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German speaking virgin girlfriend \( you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff \) He 's taking photographs , and she 's translating an esoteric German book about witches , I think br br Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it , and a real estate agent , and a woman I thought was their daughter Evidently she was an architect , and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple 's children I guess they all traveled to the island together , but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them \( maybe they were filmed separately \) br br The hotel seems neat , certainly from the exteriors , but it is n't used to any great effect An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes , which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder br br People start getting killed , either in their dreams , or sucked into hell or something Some of these gore scenes are OK , but not enough to recommend the movie Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover , the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut Much of the scene is showing another character 's reaction shots , since we 're not seeing anything ourselves The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone He looked particularly nasty There 's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her , they would do something original with her role , and let her leave Exorcist behind her \( except for the yearly horror conventions \) br br In the weird , largely Italian , tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to , this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 That is , it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 Ghosthouse , La \( 1988 \) it 's not \( that 's also a better movie than this one \) La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead \( 1981 \) and Evil Dead II \( 1987 \) again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 \( and much better than those \) There 's also a Casa 5 , La \( 1990 \) AKA House 5 , which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House \( 1986 \) House II The Second Story \( 1987 \) , The Horror Show \( 1989 \) AKA House III , and House IV \( 1992 \) How 's The Horror Show fit in there \?

I thought it was a New York located movie wrong ! It 's a little British countryside setting br br I thought it was a comedy wrong !

Maybe , a good duo of actress Yes , I know , they are 3 friends , but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me The tall doctoress surprises by her punch , and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual , all in delicate , soft and almost mute attitude This gentleness puzzles me , because as other fine artists or directors , the same pattern is repeating over and over In her case , it 's like , whatever the movie , it 's always the same character defined by her feelings , her values , who lives infinite different stories I still do n't know how to set the limit \( or the fusion \) between the artists and the works br br Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch the interesting different points of view The women have each their own way of living , even if they are all single It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people br br Finally , the movie is quite viewable , but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision

This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II I was under ten years of age And that 's the audience this serial is designed for Looking at it now , one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity The budget must have been next to nothing , given the shortcuts and repeats The acting \? Well , this is Republic pictures , 1944 They read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing br br One and half stars 
This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life I'm not even kidding It was poorly made and the actors could n't act It was a waste of my time and money It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case It appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie This was honestly an awful movie and I could n't believe how badly it was put together Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on \? The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen 's joking around making a fake fight scene br br IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show 's how awful it truly is I wish i would have watched it before i rented it 
I enjoyed the first reviewer 's comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second run theatre in the early '80 's I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings But to me , the cast was largely squandered , their personalities muffled by the masks , while the direction I think of as being unusually static , and the photography murky The rating jotted down at the time was a nought , which means not worth sitting through even once br br Still , I too would jump at a chance to have a second look 
This film is a Pia Zadora special ! When viewing it , I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for 'B' movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity , but if it is artistically necessary for the film This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Pia at such a session saying Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting , but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol This is probably grossly unfair , the rather sordid tale is the fault of Harold Robbins book considering the nature of the story Pia 's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention , and perhaps Pia \( who once won an acting award in Butterfly \) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing , but this is grossly unfair the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties The real problem with The Lonely Lady is that the screenplay , like the original book , looks for sensation rather than substance , and nothing can help with this br br The screenplay for this film is abysmal , but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script , tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement As it was released , my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion , or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing My personal rating for it would be two out of ten but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended , and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable Being in a charitable mood , and wanting to make it clear that I am not blaming Pia for my disappointment , I will give an IMDb rating of four 
The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next , but this movie was so predictable , and is just not believable I find that the more I watch this kind of movie , the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid If they took the time to make it more realistic , I might have enjoyed it a little Having said that , you might be better off staying away from this one 
This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful This movie misses the mark in almost every way Even the casting is baffling Take Audrey Landers as Val Dance 10 Looks 3 is Val 's song Val 's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department Yes , she finds a solution , but ultimately she 's a great dancer What do the brilliant filmmakers do \? They hire an actress who ca n't dance and is famous for looking great Way to miss the boat br br Then there 's the choreography I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning over in his grave Why did n't they use his choreography \? It really ca n't be improved upon 
I am a huge fan of the comic book series , but this movie fell way below my expectations I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it slow moving , bad dialogue , lots o' blood but this was worse than anything I could have imagined br br The plot line is almost the same as the comic , but the good points pretty much stop there The characters do n't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series The movie only covers a small portion of the comic , and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book br br With the right people working on this project , it could have been amazing Sadly , it was n't that way , so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out 
Oh God , I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve , \( do n't ask how \) I may have been young , but I was n't stupid Anyone could see that this is a bad movie , nasty , gross , unscary and very silly I 've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland , I 've seen better performances at a school play , And I 've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo , where they do nothing but sit in the water , ignoring the children tapping on the glass br br The story is set in northern Australia A handful of ambitious young people , are trying out a new water sport , surfing in shark filled waters It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water After they learn what , they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman , who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family br br I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years , the best of which is Lake Placid , and the worse of which is its sequel Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think , with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind br br The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there , resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature , but a good hour and a half of the viewer 's life Unless you really want to see it , avoid Blood Surf 
In 1979 Lucio Fulci released his film Zombi However , due to the earlier import of George Romero 's Dawn of the Dead , which had gone by that name for its Italian release , it was retitled to Zombi 2 \( Which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second Romero movie \) Continuing this theme , the second Zombi film , which would have been called Zombi 2 , was then consequently titled Zombi 3 In the UK , the original Zombi film \( that is , Zombi 2 \) was titled Zombie Flesh Eaters To continue THIS theme , the second Zombi film \( Zombi 3 \) was then titled Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 for its UK release \( Are you following all this \? \) So if Zombie Flesh Eaters was Fulci 's Dawn , then is 2 his Day of the Dead \? While this is only a flippant observation , this tale of military compounds , helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance br br Some of Fulci 's European direction compels in a film like this , but the acting , dubbing and exposition heavy script are absolutely horrendous Its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext , while there 's an \( unintentionally \) hilarious Birds homage Combining this last element with MOR 80s rock is not a good idea For some reason I could n't stop thinking of Time of the Apes \( q v \) the whole time I was watching this This is obviously not a good thing br br While there 's nothing here to rival topless scuba diving , shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter , Fulci 's misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner 's mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood His fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing Both themes are combined when a woman 's face is ripped off , first by one zombie , then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman 's stomach br br Production wise , this is obviously a step up from Zombi , coming five years later \( Nine years in worldwide release terms \) But without the original 's low key charm it struggles , while Stefano Mainetti 's music is inappropriate and uninspired Fabio Frizzi 's score was one of the best things about the '79 movie Here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like Bonnie Tyler 's Holding Out For A Hero In the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest , and Roger and Kenny , two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious \( We 're out of ammunition to a stalling gun is a particular standout \) But where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves Low key or not , Fulci 's original had truly magnificent , rotting zombies Skull faces , worms in eye sockets they really were something to behold By contrast , this dull follow up opts for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option br br The climax rips off too many Romero movies to even be funny , while the use of the DJ is a crass and cheap narrative device Not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first , this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal br br It turns out that Fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes , the rest filmed by Bruno Mattei I'm fairly sure that even Fulci would have balked at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene , and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave Unfortunately , however , it 's his name that 's above the film title on releases , so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a Fulci film through and through On that scale then it 's a major setback for him , for this movie commits what you imagine Fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring 
Uh oh ! Another gay film This time it 's showing the black side Bet your last dollar it 's gonna have an unhappy ending ! But WHY \? With only less than a half dozen exceptions , ALL gay films have to end in death or an addio finale It 's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40 's , 50 's , 60 's , and 70 's The lead male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion Why in God 's name must writers , directors , and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed \? After all , it 's supposed to be gay not glum Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset ! No matter who writes or produces , he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle This movie just proves my point If you rent the DVD , take an antidepressant , for here comes another 'gay' film ! This is WRONG ! 
My title above says it all Let me make it clearer If you have seen the BBC 's Planet Earth , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much And I own all the discs of Planet Earth I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it I was excited to check it out br br Alas , I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear , I recognized them from my DVDs at home of Planet Earth br br The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from Planet Earth br br We were very very disappointed , as I think 90 of the footage is from Planet Earth I am saying 90 , because some of the scenes I did n't recognize I have a feeling that I simply did n't remember them br br So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of Planet Earth , with a narration aimed at kids Yes , the narration is quite kiddish Let me give you an example When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says The polar cubs are not like human kids They do n't always listen to their mothers \( I do n't remember the exact words , but this is how it is \) So in a nutshell This is condensed Planet Earth for kids ! 
I do n't know much about film making , but good movies have to tell some sort of a story your characters have to start and complete their journey In Last Exit to Brooklyn they may , but its not in any satisfying way , and I'm not meaning a happy ending , just ANY ending br br Last Exit to Brooklyn , set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike , sets a number of story threads in motion Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion it leaves some of them dangling with no ending , or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an artistic ending br br Two cases in point , and they contain spoilers br br A sad transvestite character \( an important character in the film \) , is struck by a car and killed And that 's it for him in the movie he 's gone for good , erased from everyone 's memory no reactions from his friends , enemies , lovers nothing br br In another thread the stupid , clueless , and secretly gay strike leader , having been rejected by labor , his gay lover , and found out by the neighborhood thugs , gets stomped by the thugs The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn , and the streetlights are very , very similar to those of Nazi death camps and the scene drags on and on and on and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader , and he 's been crucified ppppuuuulllleeeeeez And of course that 's it for him too brain erasure gone br br Bottom line no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film this movie is a depressing piece of sludge Avoid it And if you do n't be forewarned , it really deserves an NC 17 rating for massive amounts of physical , emotional and sexual brutality do n't even let the teenagers watch 
Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD , and because he loves kids That did n't work \( and why should it \? \) , so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor 's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy that 's a step closer to ISHTAR Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked , but do n't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he does n't belong in this movie , and the same went for DR DOLITTLE ! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic , and that would n't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy Speaking of visuals , they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan 's presidential fame Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS , but this stale movie is n't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste 
This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I have seen It is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by Bronte George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling as Rochester when not just plain old acting angry Susannah York has the most dated 1970 's hairstyle I have ever seen in a Victorian movie The characters hardly speak to each other , so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love , is gone The ending is ludicrous br br Please , rent the Timothy Dalton version instead It is so true to the book , it 's like having the novel read aloud to you Dalton is superb as Rochester G C Scott is laughable

Thunderbirds are GO ! br br And so began Thunderbirds , a childhood favorite of mine When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie , I was ecstatic I could n't wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar in to save people , while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the you get the idea I just could n't wait Then came August 2004 , when the movie was finally released Critics panned it , but I still wanted to go After all , as long as the heart was in the same place , that was all that mattered to me So I sat down in the theater , the only teenager in a crowd of 50 everyone else was over thirty and under ten Quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that I have ever had br br The movie \( which is intended to be a prequel \) focuses on Alan Tracy \( Brady Corbet \) , the youngest of the Tracy family He spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family , but he 's too young One day , he finally gets his chance when The Hood \( Ben Kingsley \) traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird 5 \( the space station \) This involves him having to outsmart The Hood 's henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all of the money from the Bank of England br br Trust me , the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper Once it gets put on to film what a mess we have on our hands First off , the film was intended for children , much like the original show was However , Gerry Anderson treated us like adults , and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children 's programming This on the other hand , dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children , while missing both entirely Lame jokes , cartoonish sounds , and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie , and I'm sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing he 'd never directed this br br Over all , everyone gave a solid performance , considering the script that they were all given Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood , playing the part extremely well My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood 's henchmen , who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons , bumbling about as , amazingly enough , the kids take them on with ease br br What 's odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie , I had fun But once the lights went up , I realized that the movie was fairly bad , I was 8 lighter , and two hours of my time were now gone A guilty pleasure \? Perhaps Nonetheless , Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess Instead of a big go , I'm going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it , it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name However , we get a movie that only die hard Thunderbirds fans \( if you 'd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces \) or the extremely bored should bother with br br My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 stars 
A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China Wang Lung \( Paul Muni \) buys O Lan , his future wife , who becomes his slave \( Luis Rainer \) American stars appear in the leading roles , talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology A good wife , many children and land are the best things for men to have They are seen as property and investment Because it is a big budget movie , in which many extras cooperate , big sets are built and special effects take place , the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance , which is definitely the worst in the movie Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience O Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance , showing his talent ones again Another problem with the movie is the ending It seems like Franklin did not know when to end the picture This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and traditions 
It is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the over the top writing of Michael O'Donoghugh magazine articles and SNL skits that were genius for the time and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos thus leading them to MR MIKES MONDO VIDEO br br This movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone The viewer experiences such things as cat diving swimming with the man who thinks he 's found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence Then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired \( hula hops , pet rocks , rainbow dread wigs etc \) Then we enter the music world \( punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film \) where D rate bar performer Rootboy Slim performs boogie till you puke in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze Now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music In many different styles with many different instruments the sound of TELSTAR plays and replays for those who do n't understand Telstar was the first American Satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph MR MIKES seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes Now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of Sid Vicious \( ex sex pistol not the wrestler \) singing MY WAY His version is very different than Sinatras as one might imagine but frankly I feel it is very much worth the listen it 's good ! That is the sad part in the VHS release Paul Anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1 2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol br br I would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is pass I can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2 5 If you want to see a good O'Donoghugh script watch SCROOGED it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent 
This service comedy , for which Peter Marshall \( Joanne Dru 's brother and later perennial host of The Hollywood Squares \) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as 'the new Lewis and Martin' is just shy of dreadful a few random sight gags are inserted , everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right there 's one scene in which Noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger they 're about five feet apart , Noonan is throwing them in between , and the total reaction is that everyone flinches br br In the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching Julie Newmar , there are a few moments of brightness Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying , and their timing is nigh unto perfect clearly they were a well honed comedy pair br br It is n't enough to save this turkey , alas 
I watched the movie The Flock because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting This was one of the WORST movies I 've seen in a long while \( and I 've seen some turkeys \) I 've never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it 's unbelievable The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it 's nauseating Poor Gere , he deserves so much better As for the Gere Danes on screen matchup , because of the horrible writing , one does n't believe either character for a single minute I 'll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative , were such a thing possible It 's a shame to see talent wasted so badly , not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back \( I know what you 're thinking How do I really feel \? \) 
I do n't think this movie was rated correctly I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 , whatever the R limit is br br Why \? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women I do n't know about you , but that 's not something for little children to be watching True , it might be the traditional clothing style of the African \( \? \) Indians , but I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating br br I have n't seen the movie recently , but I guess otherwise , it was alright 
Boy girl love affair sequel with songs , only this time she 's the punkette and he 's the straight arrow Movie buffs out there actually like this movie \? It has fans \? I must say , the mind reels Grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that does n't even have the courage , moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames \( like Jaws 2 or Exorcist II \) No , it whimpers along in slow motion and often just plays dead It looks and feels cheap , with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and , although she does n't embarrass herself , it 's a role worth forgetting A misfire on the lowest of levels NO STARS from 
One of the most peculiar oft used romance movie plots is this one A seriously messed up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman , who turns his life around before dying Occasionally this story is done well and realistically \( as in The Theory of Flight , an excellent weepie \) , but more frequently it 's done like it is here , where as usual the heroine dies of Old Movie Disease You know , the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you 're telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks are n't affected one bit \( and since this is the 70 's , neither is your sex life \) This is one of the worst versions made of that particular story , where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together , and they 're played by actors who are completely at sea br br This has got to be the worst performance of Al Pacino 's career , and I say that after having seen The Devil 's Advocate only two days ago ! He plays a control freak , emotionally constipated race car driver , and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly He seems to constantly be asking himself why he 's staying around the grating Marthe Keller \( so does the audience \) , and spends most of the movie just standing there , usually with his mouth hanging open The only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end , where his character proves that he 's changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad Mae West imitation Hey , it was the seventies ! br br Marthe Keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying , and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of , say , Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie Instead , they got the expressionless face and heavy German accent of Ms Keller , who comes across as more of a scary Teutonic stereotype \( You VILL eat ze omelet ! \) than anything like lovable She 's supposed to be reforming Pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that , but it does n't work that way , it 's more like she 's harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion This makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history , where you ca n't believe she 'd be with someone she finds so worthless , and you ca n't believe he 's with someone who gets on his nerves that much br br Some bad movie fans call this a cult classic , mostly because of Pacino 's silly liberating Mae West imitation The scene is a scream , especially in context , but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for No , only see the film if you 're a serious bad movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying Extreme Lack of Chemistry between leading actors , or Very Bad Casting \( not only are the leads terrible , but Pacino 's other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes Keller with shorter hair , I got them totally confused \) This is n't one of those laugh a minute bad movies like The Conqueror , it 's just a really , really bad movie br br 
I went for this movie believing it had good ratings Firstly , it is ridiculous that they 're releasing a movie originally made in 2001 , seven years later in 2008 here in India Everything in the movie looks dated Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get Anthony Hopkins does n't seem to know what he is doing in the film He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end If the film had bright sparks during that scene , I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil She wears ill fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed What a waste of money ! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it , Go back home and write better ! 
When the film began , I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera ! In fact , the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie Even direct to DVD films should have production values better than this ! Heck , a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values ! All too often , the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on with no camera person ! Closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups Yecch ! br br The film is about two gay men who want to become married As if was made almost a decade ago , their only option was marrying in Vermont times have definitely changed However , the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything , it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue According to the film , religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie go figure I'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue ! br br The bottom line nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and I even hesitate to call this a film It 's more like a home movie and does n't even merit a listing on IMDb or even inclusion on IMDb 's Bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time The acting is horrible , the writing is horrible , the direction \( if there even is any \) is horrible , the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible It 's a home movie ! ! There is nothing positive I can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of Ed Wood seem like Oscar contenders in comparison and I am sure the ghost of Mr Wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess ! br br I do n't care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and I do n't know how they managed to create DVDs of it I assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time ! Seriously , this gives new meaning to the word 'bad' ! br br By the way , if the one lady in the film WAS a real lawyer , would n't the ability to read be an important prerequisite \? ! I'm just sayin' br br Finally , with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic , ca n't we have a film that 's BETTER than THIS that addresses the issue \? ! This one , sadly , only invites laughter 
Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything I am not sure how much John Rys Daves got , but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950 's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both life like and real 
I did n't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out Still , I held out hope It sounded a bit much like Bride and Prejudice \( L A guy falls for an Indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah \) B P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters br br My Bollywood Bride had none of that The acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers Characters were so clich the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student Technically , the sound really bothered me It seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue I mean a lot I know sometimes it 's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting br br Two stars is being somewhat generous 
There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award Well , it does not deserve an audience as well Ironically , one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly , the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least Every frame , you feel you are getting the full picture , its like someone is cropping your view from the edges The story is pathetic Well , I will be honest , I could not bear to watch the entire movie The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal br br Take my advice , stay away from this piece of crap 
This film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers The main point of the book , the insights , are hardly even touched upon , leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives br br The character development is not good at all No background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them , and so the action sequences fall flat br br The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly , and with no real explanation , not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for br br This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen It is horrible and a waste of time If you have not read the book , skip the movie and read it If you have read the book , skip the movie and reread it br br It is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book , that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is It is a shame too , because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors br br Please do n't waste your time , READ THE BOOK ! ! ! 
Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production , BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list , utterly lacking the style , imagination , and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor , BATMAN br br The producer , Sam Katzman , was known as King of the Quickies and , like his director , Spencer Bennett , seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement \( Unfortunately , this team also produced the two Superman serials , starring Kirk Alyn , with their tacky flying animation , canned music , and dull supporting players \) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles \( Robin Rescues Batman , Batman vs Wizard \) , mechanical music droning on , and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around , either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks Batman 's cowl , with its devil 's horns and eagle 's beak , fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes His utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments , from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments ! br br In any case , the lead players are miscast Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne , and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman He creates the impression that he 'd rather be somewhere , anywhere else ! John Duncan , as Robin , has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue He is too old for the part , with an even older stuntman filling in for him Out of costume , Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink , without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial br br Although serials were not known for character development , the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast This one offers a group going through the motions , not that the filmmakers provide much support Not one of the hoodlums stands out , and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever , The Wizard \( Great name ! \) Actually , they are led by someone sporting a curtain , a shawl , and a sack over his head , with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing The prime suspects an eccentric professor , a radio broadcaster are simply annoying br br Even the established comic book regulars are superfluous It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne Despite the perils she faces , Vicki displays virtually no emotion Commissioner Gordon is none too bright Unlike in the previous serial , Alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is Mr Wayne 's residence They are props for a drawn out , gimmick laden , incoherent plot , further saddled with uninspired , repetitive music and amateurish production design The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom , the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing \( The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet ! \) br br Pity that the filmmakers could n't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious Batfan , one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined br br Now for the good news this is not the 1997 version ! 
I think we all begin a lot of reviews with , This could 've made a GREAT movie A demented ex con freshly sprung , a tidy suburban family his target Revenge , retribution , manipulation Marty 's usual laying on of the Karo syrup But unfortunately somewhere in Universal 's high rise a memorandum came down everyone ham it up br br Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised , Lange bitches her way through cigarettes , Lewis Ohmagod 's ! her way though her scenes , and Bobby D well , he 's on a whole other magic carpet Affecting some sort of Cajun Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid , he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as Problem Child And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above Now imagine it spouting brain clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles , and you have De Niro 's schtick here Most distracting of all , though , is his most OVERDONE use of the De Niro face he 's so lampooned for Eyes squinting , forehead crinkled , lips curled Crimany , Bob , you looked like Plastic Man br br The story apparently began off screen 14 years earlier , when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults Upon release , he feels Nolte 's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin And we 're supposed to give De Niro 's character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might 've shortened his sentence De Niro being one of these criminals who , despite being guilty of unspeakable acts , feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside Mmm kay br br He goes after Notle 's near mistress \( in a scene some may want to turn away from \) , his wife , his daughter , the family dog , ya know Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick 's screenplay utter predictability As each of De Niro 's harassments becomes more gruesome , you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens Strick is n't to be totally discredited , as he manages a few compelling dialogue driven moments \( De Niro and Lewis' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film 's best scene \) , but mostly it 's all over cranked Scorsese 's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced , not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re worked Bernard Hermann score \( I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula \) br br Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick Unintentionally comedic , that is You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening , but you ca n't help but snicker out of sight of others \? You 'll do it here Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity , De Niro 's thumb flirting , he cross dressing , and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed And Bob 's infernal , incessant , CONSTANT , mind damaging , no end in sight blowhard ramblings of all the philosophy he disovered in prison I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family br br I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers , but here it 's necessary This really is Scorsese 's version of Freddy Krueger The manner in which De Niro relishes , speaks , stalks , withstands pain , right down to his one liners , is vintage Freddy Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water You trying' to offer sumpin' hot \? Please And that 's just one example br br Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam , Peck , and Mitchum nearly 30 years later \( or want a serious head shaking film experience \) , avoid a trip to the Cape 
Do you like stand up \? Then stay away from this br br During the early rounds , there are in fact good comics , but unless they got some cute qualities , they got a snowballs chance Any controversial material and you are OUT ! and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians , when I see who the crooked judges are letting in br br 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries Half of the finalists have given me 0 laughs Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere , something the judges does n't seem to have problems with br br It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV , but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been br br If the producers changed the name of the contest to Last Clown Standing , all my criticism would loose validity Maybe an idea \?
